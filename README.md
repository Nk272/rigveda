Entites - Deities, RIshis, Mandalas [10]

Edges (links) show the relationships—for example:
    “This Rishi composed hymns to this Deity.”
    “This Deity is praised in these Mandalas.”

When you click on a Deity node, the interface:

highlights all connected Rishis/Mandalas,

lists the relevant mantras in a side panel,

and lets you play audio of those mantras while a visualizer animates with the sound.
