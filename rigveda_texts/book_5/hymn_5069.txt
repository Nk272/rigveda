==================================================

. THREE spheres of light, O Varuṇa, three heavens, three firmaments ye comprehend, O Mitra:Waxed strong, ye keep the splendour of dominion, guarding the Ordinance that lasts for ever. Ye, Varuṇa, have kine who yield refreshment; Mitra, your floods pour water full of sweetness.There stand the Three Steers, splendid in their brightness, who fill the three world-bowls with genial moisture. I call at dawn on Aditi the Goddess, I call at noon and when the Sun is setting.I pray, O Mitra-Varuṇa, for safety, for wealth and progeny, in rest and trouble. Ye who uphold the region, sphere of brightness, ye who support earth's realm Divine Ādityas,The Immortal Gods, O Varuṇa and Mitra, never impair your everlasting statutes.
