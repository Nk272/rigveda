==================================================

. WHETHER, O Aśvins, ye this day be far remote or near at hand,In many spots or in mid-air, come hither, Lords of ample wealth. These here, who show o’er widest space, bringing full many a wondrous act,Resistless, lovingly I seek, I call the Mightiest to enjoy. Another beauteous wheel have ye fixed there to decorate your car.With others through the realms ye roam in might unto the neighbouring tribes. That deed of yours that is extolled, Visvas! hath all been done with this.Born otherwise, and spotless, ye have entered kinship's bonds with us. When Sūrya mounted on your car that rolls for ever rapidly,Birds of red hue were round about and burning splendours compassed you. Atri bethinks himself of you, O Heroes, with a friendly mind,What time, Nāsatyas, with his mouth he stirs the spotless flame for you. Strong is your swiftly moving steed, famed his exertion in the courseWhen by your great deeds, Aśvins, Chiefs, Atri is brought to us again. Lovers of sweetness, Rudras, she who streams with sweetness waits on you.When ye have travelled through the seas men bring you gifts of well-dressed food. Aśvins, with truth they call you Twain bestowers of felicity;At sacrifice most prompt to hear, most gracious ye at sacrifice. Most pleasing to the Aśvins be these prayers which magnify their might,Which we have fashioned, even as cars high reverence have we spoken forth.
