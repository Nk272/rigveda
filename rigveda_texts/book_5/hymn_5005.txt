==================================================

. To Agni, Jātavedas, to the flame, the well-enkindled God,Offer thick sacrificial oil. He, Narāśaṁsa, ne’er beguiled, inspiriteth this sacrifice:For sage is he, with sweets in hand. Adored, O Agni, hither bring Indra the Wonderful, the Friend,On lightly-rolling car to aid. Spread thyself out, thou soft as wool The holy hymns have sung to thee.Bring gain to us, O beautiful! Open yourselves, ye Doors Divine, easy of access for our aid:Fill, more and more, the sacrifice. Fair strengtheners of vital power, young Mothers of eternal Law,Morning and Night we supplicate. On the wind's flight come, glorified, ye two celestial Priests of manCome ye to this our sacrifice. Iḷā, Sarasvatī, Mahī, three Goddesses who bring us weal,Be seated harmless on the grass. Rich in all plenty, Tvaṣṭar, come auspicious of thine own accordHelp us in every sacrifice. Vanaspati, wherever thou knowest the Gods’ mysterious names,Send our oblations thitherward. To Agni and to Varuṇa, Indra, the Maruts, and the Gods,With Svāhā be oblation brought.
