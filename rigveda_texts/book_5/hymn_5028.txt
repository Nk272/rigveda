==================================================

. AGNI inflamed hath sent to heaven his lustre: he shines forth widely turning unto Morning.Eastward the ladle goes that brings all blessing, praising the Godswith homage and oblation. Enkindled, thou art King of the immortal world: him who brings offerings thou attendest for his weal.He whom thou urgest on makes all possessions his: he sets before thee, Agni, gifts that guests may claim. Show thyself strong for mighty bliss, O Agni, most excellent be thine effulgent splendours.Make easy to maintain our household lordship, and overcome the might of those who hate us. Thy glory, Agni, I adore, kindled, exalted in thy strength.A Steer of brilliant splendour, thou art lighted well at sacred rites. Agni, invoked and kindled, serve the Gods, thou skilled in sacrifice:For thou art bearer of our gifts. Invoke and worship Agni while the sacrificial rite proceeds:For offering-bearer choose ye him.
