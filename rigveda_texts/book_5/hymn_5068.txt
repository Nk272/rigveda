==================================================

. SING forth unto your Varuṇa and Mitra with a song inspired.They, Mighty Lords, are lofty Law Full springs of fatness, Sovran Kings, Mitra. and Varuṇa, the Twain,Gods glorified among the Gods. So help ye us to riches, great terrestrial and celestial wealth:Vast is your sway among the Gods. Carefully tending Law with Law they have attained their vigorous might.The two Gods wax devoid of guile. With rainy skies and streaming floods, Lords of the strength that bringeth gifts,A lofty seat have they attained.
