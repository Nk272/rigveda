==================================================

. INDRA, for our assistance bring that most effectual power of thine,Which conquers men for us, and wins the spoil, invincible in fight. Indra, whatever aids be thine, four be they, or, O Hero, three,Or those of the Five Tribes of men, bring quickly all that help to us. The aid most excellent of thee the Mightiest hitherward we call,For thou wast born with hero might, conquering, Indra, with the Strong. Mighty to prosper us wast thou born, and mighty is the strength thou hast.In native power thy soul is firm: thy valour, Indra, slays a host. O Śatakratu, Lord of Strength, O Indra, Caster of the Stone.With all thy chariot's force assail the man who shows himself thy foe. For, Mightiest Vṛtra-slayer, thee, fierce, foremost among many, folkWhose sacred grass is trimmed invite to battle where the spoil is won. Indra, do thou protect our car that mingles foremost in the fights,That bears its part in every fray, invincible and seeking spoil. Come to us, Indra, and protect our car with thine intelligence.May we, O Mightiest One, obtain excellent fame at break of day, and meditate our hymn at dawn.
