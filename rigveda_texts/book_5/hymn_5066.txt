==================================================

. O SAPIENT man, call the Two Gods, the very wise, who slay the foe.For Varuṇa, whose form is Law, place offerings for his great delight. For they have won unbroken sway in full perfection, power divine.And, like high laws, the world of man hath been made beautiful as light. Therefore we praise you that your cars may travel far in front of ours-You who accept the eulogy of Ratahavya with his hymns. And ye show wMom, Wondrous Gods with fulness of intellIgence.By men's discernment are Ve marked, O ye whose might is purified. This is the Law sublime, O Earth: to aid the Ṛṣis’ toil for fameThe Two, wide-spreading, are prepared. They come with ample overflow. Mitra, ye Gods with wandering eyes, would that the worshippers and weMight strive to reach the realm ye rule, most spacious and protected well,
