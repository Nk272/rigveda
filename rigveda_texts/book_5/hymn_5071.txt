==================================================

. O Varuṇa and Mitra, ye who slay the foemen, come with mightTo this our goodly sacrifice. For, Varuṇa and Mitra, ye Sages are Rulers over all. Fill full our songs, for this ye can. Come to the juice that we have pressed. Varuṇa, Mitra, come to drinkThis Soma of the worshipper.
