==================================================

. O HEAVENLY Dawn, awaken us to ample opulence to-dayEven as thou hast wakened us with Satyasravas, Vayya's son, high-born! delightful with thy steeds! Daughter of Heaven, thou dawnedst on Sunitha Sucadratha's son,So dawn thou on one mightier still, on Satyasravas, Vayya's son, high-born! delightful with thy steeds! So, bringing treasure, dawn to-day on us thou Daughter of the Sky,As thou, O mightier yet. didst shine for Satyatravas, Vayya's son, high-born! delightful with thy steeds! Here round about thee are the priests who laud thee, Bright One, with their hymns,And men with gifts, O Bounteous Dame, splendid with wealth and offering much, high-born! delightful with thy steeds! Whatever these thy bands perform to please thee or to win them wealth,E’en fain they gird us round and give rich gifts which ne’er are reft away, high-born! delightful with thy steeds! Give to these wealthy patrons fame, O affluent Dawn, with hero sons,To these our princes who have brought rich gifts ne’er to be reft away, highborn! delightful with thy steeds! Bring lofty and resplendent fame, O thou munificent Dawn, to theseOur wealthy patrons who bestow rich gifts on us of steeds and kine, high-born! delightful with thy steeds! Bring us, O Daughter of the Sky, subsistence in our herds of kine,Together with the sunbeams, with the shine of pure refulgent flames, highborn! delightful with thy steeds! O Daughter of the Sky, shine forth; delay not to perform thy task.Let not the Sun with fervent heat consume thee like a robber foe, high-born! delightful with the steeds! So much, and more exceedingly, O Dawn, it suits thee to bestow,Thou Radiant One who ceasest not to shine for those who sing thy praise, highborn! delightful with thy steeds!
