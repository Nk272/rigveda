==================================================

. HITHERWARD have the Soma streamed,the drops while they are purified:When bIent, in waters they are rinsed. The milk hath run to meet them like floods rushing down a precipice:They come to Indra, being cleansed. O Soma Pavamana, thou art flowing to be Indra's drink:The men have seized and lead thee forth. Victorious, to be hailed with joy, O Soma, flow, delighting men,To him who ruleth o’er mankind. Thou, Indu, when, effused by stones, thou runnest to the filter, art,Ready for Indra's high decree. Flow on, best Vṛtra-slayer; flow meet to be hailed with joyful lauds.Pure, purifying, wonderful. Pure, purifying is he called the Soma of the meath eflused,Slayer of sinners, dear to Gods.
