==================================================

. GREEN-HUED! as one who giveth strength flow on for Gods to drink, a draughtFor Vāyu and the Marut host. O Pavamana, sent by song, roaring about thy dwelling-place,Pass into Vāyu as Law bids. The Steer shines with the Deities, dear Sage in his appointed home,Foe-Slayer, most beloved by Gods. Taking each beauteous form, he goes, desirable, while purified,Thither where- the Immortals sit. To Indra Soma flows, the Red, engendering song, exceeding wise,The visitor of living men. Flow, best exhilarator, Sage, flow to the filter in a streamTo seat thee in the place of song.
