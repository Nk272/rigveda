==================================================

. THE man who waIketh as the Laws of Indu Pavamana bid,—Men call him rich in children, him, O Soma, who hath met thy thought. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake. Kasyapa, Ṛṣi, lifting up thy voice with hymn-composers' lauds,Pav reverence to King Soma born the Sovran Ruler of the plants. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake. Seven regions have their several Suns; the ministering priests are seven;Seven are the Āditya Deities,—with these, O Soma, guard thou us. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake. Guard us with this oblation which, King Soma, hath been dressed for thee.
