==================================================

. SING forth and laud with sacred song most active Pavamana, laudIndu who sees with thousand eyes. Thee who hast thousand eyes to see, bearer of thousand burthens, theyHave filtered through the fleecy cloth. He, Pavamana, hath streamed through the fleece then: he runs into the jars,Finding his way to Indra's heart. That Indra may be bounteous, flow, most active Soma, for our weal:Bring genial seed with progeny.
