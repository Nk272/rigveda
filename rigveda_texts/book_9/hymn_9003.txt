==================================================

. HERE present this Immortal God flies, like a bird upon her wings,To settle in the vats of wood. This God, made ready with the hymn, runs swiftly through the winding ways,Inviolable as he flows. This God while flowing is adorned, like a bay steed for war, by menDevout and skilled in holy songs. He, like a warrior going forth with heroes, as he flows alongIs fain to win all precious boons. This God, as he is flowing on, speeds like a car and gives his gifts:He lets his voice be heard of all Praised by the sacred bards, this God dives into waters, and bestowsRich gifts upon the worshipper. Away he rushes with his stream, across the regions, into heaven,And roars as he is flowing on. While flowing, meet for sacrifice, he hath gone up to heaven acrossThe regions, irresistible. After the 'way of ancient time, this God, pressed out for Deities,Flows tawny to the straining-cloth. This Lord of many Holy Laws, even at his birth engendering strength,Effused, flows onward in a stream.
