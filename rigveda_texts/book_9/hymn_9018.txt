==================================================

. THOU, Soma, dweller on the hills, effused, hast flowed into the sieve,:All-bounteous art thou in carouse. Thou art a sacred Bard, a Sage; the meath is offipring of thy sap:All-bountcous art thou in carouse. All Deities of one accord have come that they may drink of thee:All-bounteous art thou in carouse. He who containeth in his hands all treasures much to be desired:All-bounteous art thou in carouse. Who milketh out this mighty Pair, the Earth and Heaven, like mother kineAll-bounteous art thou in carouse. Who in a moment mightily floweth around these two world-halvcs:All-bounteous art thou in carouse. The Strong One, being purified, hath in the pitchers cried aloud:All-bounteous art thou in carouse.
