==================================================

. O Soma flowing on thy way, win thou and conquer high renown;And make us better than we are. Win thou the light, win heavenly light, and, Soma, all felicities;And make us better than we are. Win skilful strength and mental power. O Soma, drive away our foes;And make us better than we are. Ye purifiers, purify Soma for Indra, for his drink:Make thou us better than we are. Give us our portion in the Sun through thine own mental power and aids;And make us better than we are. Through thine own mental power and aid long may we look upon the Sun;Make thou us better than we are. Well-weaponed Soma, pour to usa stream of riches doubly great;And make us better than we are. As one victorious unsubdued in battle pour forth wealth to us;And make us better than we are. By worship, Pavamana! men have strengthened thee to prop the Law:Make thou us better than we are. O Indu, bring us wealth in steeds, manifold. quickening all life;And mate us better than we are.
