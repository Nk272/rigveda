==================================================

. FLOW onward, Soma, winning kine, and steeds, and all that gives delight:Bring hither wealth with progeny. Flow onward from the waters, flow, inviolable, from the plants:Flow onward from the pressing-boards. Soma, as Pavamana, pass over all trouble and distress:Sit on the sacred grass, a Sage. Thou, Pavamana, foundest light; thou at thy birth becamest great:O Indu, thou art over all.
