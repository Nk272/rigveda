==================================================

. TEN sisters, pouring out the rain together, swift-moving thinkers of the sage, adorn him.Hither hath run the gold-hued Child of SÅ«rya and reached the vat like a fleet vigorous courser. Even as a youngling crying to his mothers, the bounteous Steer hath flowed along to waters.As youth to damsel, so with milk he hastens on to the. chose meeting-place, the beaker. Yea, swollen is the udder of the milch-cow: thither in streams goes very sapient Indu.The kine make ready, as with new-washed treasures, the Head and Chief with milk within the vessels. With all the Gods, O Indu Pavamana, while thou art roaring send us wealth in horses.Hither upon her car come willing Plenty, inclined to us, to give us of her treasures. Now unto us mete riches, while they cleansethee, all-glorious, swelling wealth, with store of heroes.Long be his life who worships, thee, O Indu. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.
