==================================================

. ENKINDLED, Pavamana, Lord, sends forth his light on, every sideIn friendly show, the bellowing Bull. He, Pavamana, Self-produced, speeds onward sharpening his horns:He glitters through the firmament. Brilliant like wealth, adorable, with splendour Pavamana shines,Mightily with the streams of meath. The tawny Pavamana, who strews from of old the grass with might,Is worshipped, God amid the Gods. The golden, the Celestial Doors are lifted with their frames on high,By Pavamana glorified. With passion Pavamana longs for the great lofty pair, well-formedLike beauteous maidens, Night and Dawn Both Gods who look on men I call, Celestial Heralds: Indra's SelfIs Pavamana, yea, the Bull. This, Pavamana's sacrifice, shall the three beauteous Goddesses,Sarasvatī and Bhāratī and Iḷā, Mighty One, attend. summon Tvaṣṭar hither, our protector, champion, earliest-born,Indu is Indra, tawny Steer; Pavamana is Prajāpati. O Pavamana, with the meath in streams anoint Vanaspati,The ever-green. the golden-hued, refulgent, with a thousand boughs. Come to the consecrating rite of Pavamana, all ye Gods,—Vāyu, Sūrya, Bṛhaspati, Indra, and Agni, in accord.
