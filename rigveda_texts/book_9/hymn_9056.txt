==================================================

. SWIFT to the purifying sieve flows Soma as exalted Law,Slaying the fiends, loving the Gods. When Soma pours the strengthening food a hundred ever-active streamsTo Indra's friendship win theirway. Ten Dames have sung to welcome thee, even as a maiden greets her love:O Soma, thou art decked to win. Flow hitherward, O Indu, sweet to Indra and to Viṣṇu: guardThe men, the singers, from distress.
