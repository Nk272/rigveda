==================================================

. SOMA, the Steer, effused for draught, flows to the purifying sieve,Slaying the fiends, loving the Gods. Far-sighted, tawny-coloured, he flows to the sieve, intelligent,Bellowing, to his place of rest. This vigorous Pavamana runs forth to the luminous realm of heaven,Fiend-slayer, through the fleecy sieve. This Payamana up above Trita's high ridge hath made the Sun,Together with the Sisters, shine. This Vṛtra-slaying Steer, effused, Soma room-giver, ne’er deceived,Hath gone, as ’twere, to win the spoil. Urged onward by the sage, the God speeds forward to the casks of wood,Indu to Indra willingly.
