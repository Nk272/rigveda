==================================================

. FORTH on their way the glorious drops have flowed for maintenance of Law,Knowing this sacrifice's course. Down in the mighty waters sinks the stream of meath, most excellent,Oblation best of all in worth. About the holy place, the Steer true, guileless, noblest, hath sent forthContinuous voices in the wood. When, clothed in manly strength, the Sage flows in celestial wisdom round,The Strong would win the light of heaven. When purified, he sits as King above the hosts, among his folk,What time the sages bring him nigh. Dear, golden-coloured, in the fleece he sinks and settles in the wood:The Singer shows his zeal in hymns. He goes to Indra, Vāyu, to the Aśvins, as his custom is,With gladdening juice which gives them joy. Tle streams of pleasant Soma flow to Bhaga, Mitra-Varuṇa,—Well-knowing through his mighty powers.Heaven and Earth, riches of meath to win us wealth:Gain for us treasures and renown.
