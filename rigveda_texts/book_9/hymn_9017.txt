==================================================

. LIKE rivers down a steep descent, slaying the Vṛtras, full of zeal,The rapid Soma-streams have flowed. The drops of Soma juice effused fall like the rain upon the earth:To Indra flow the Soma-streams. With swelling wave the gladdening drink, the Soma, flows intoṭhe sieve,Loving the Gods and slaying fiends. It hastens to the pitchers, poured upon the sieve it waxes strongAt sacrifices through the lauds. Soma, thou shinest mounting heaven as ’twere above light's triple realm,And moving secm'st to speed the Sun. To him, the head of sacnfice, singers and bards have sung their songs,Offering what he loves to see. The men, the sages with their hymns, eager for help, deck thee strong &teed,Deck thee for service of the Gods. Flow onward to the stream of meath rest efficacious in thy home,Fair, to be drunk at sacrifice.
