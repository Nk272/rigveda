==================================================

. REPOSING on the river's wave the Sage hath widely flowed around,Bearing the hymn which many love. When the Five kindred Companies, active in duty, with the songEstablish him, the Powerful, Then in his juice whose strength is great, have all the Gods rejoiced themselves,When he hath clothed him in the milk. Freeing himself he flows away, leaving his body's severed limbs,And meets his own Companion here. He by the daughters of the priest, like a fair youth, hath been adorned,Making the milk, as â€™twere, his robe. O'er the fine fingers, through desire of milk, in winding course he goes,And utters voice which he hath found. The nimble fingers have approached, adorning him the Lord of Strength:They grasp the vigorous Courser's back. Comprising all the treasures that are in the heavens and on the earth,Come, Soma, as our faithful Friend.
