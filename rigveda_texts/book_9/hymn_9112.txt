==================================================

. WE all have various thoughts and plans, and diverse are the ways of men.The Brahman seeks the worshipper, wright seeks the cracked, and leech the maimed. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake. The smith with ripe and seasoned plants, with feathers of the birds of air,With stones, and with enkindled flames, seeks him who hath a store of gold. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake. A bard am I, my dad's a leech, mammy lays corn upon the stones.Striving for wealth, with varied plans, we follow our desires like kine. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake. The horse would draw an easy car, gay hosts attract the laugh and jest.The male desires his mate's approach, the frog is eager for the flood, Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.
