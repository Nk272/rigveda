==================================================

. AFTER his ancient splendour, they, the bold, have drawn the bright milk fromThe Sage who wins a thousand gifts. In aspect he is like the Sun; he runneth forward to the lakes,Seven currents flowing through the sky. He, shining in his splendour, stands high over all things that exist-Soma, a God as SÅ«rya is. Thou, Indu, in thy brilliancy, pourest on us, as Indra's Friend,Wealth from the kine to feast the Gods.
