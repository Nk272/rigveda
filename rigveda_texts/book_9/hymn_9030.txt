==================================================

. STREAMS of this Potent One have flowed easily to the straining-cloth:While he is cleansed he lifts his voice. Indu, by pressers urged to speed, bellowing out while beautified.Sends forth a very mighty sound. Pour on us, Soma, with thy stream manconquering might which many crave,Accompanied with hero sons. Hither hath Pavamana flowed, Soma flowed hither in a stream,To settle in the vats of wood. To waters with the stones they drive thee tawny-hued, most rich in sweets,O Indu, to be Indra's drink. For Indra, for the Thunderer press the Soma very rich in sweets,Lovely, inspiriting, for strength.
