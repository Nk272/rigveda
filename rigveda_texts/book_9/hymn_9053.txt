==================================================

. O THOU with stones for arms, thy powers, crushing the fiends, have raised themselves:Chase thou the foes who compass us. Thou conquerest thus with might when car meets car, and when the prize is staked:With fearless heart will I sing praise. No one with evil thought assails this Pavamana's holy laws:Crush him who fain would fight with thee. For Indra to the streams they drive the tawny rapture-dropping Steed,Indu the bringer of delight.
