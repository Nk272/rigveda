==================================================

. THIS Steer, this Chariot, rushes through the woollen filter, as he goesTo war that wins a thousand spoils. The Dames of Trita with the stones onward impel this Tawny OneIndu to Indra for his drink. Ten active fingers carefully adorn him here; they make him brightAnd beauteous for the gladdening draught. He like a falcon settles down amid the families of men.Speeding like lover to his love. This young exhilarating juice looks downward from its place in heaven,This Soma-drop that pierced the sieve. Poured for the draught, this tawny juiceflows forth, intelligent, crying out,Unto the well-beloved place.
