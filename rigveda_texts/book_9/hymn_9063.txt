==================================================

. POUR hitherward, O Soma, wealth in thousands and heroic strength,And keep renown secure for us. Thou makest food and vigour swell for Indra, best of gladdeners!Within the cups thou seatest thee. For Indra and for Viṣṇu poured, Soma hath flowed into the jar:May Vāyu find it rich in sweets. These Somas swift and brown of hue, in stream of solemn sacrificeHave flowed through twisted obstacles, Performing every noble work, active, augmenting Indra's strength,Driving away the godless ones. Brown Soma-drops, effused that seek Indra, to their appropriate placeFlow through the region hitherward. Flow onward with that stream of thine wherewith thou gavest Sūrya light,Urging on waters good to men. He, Pavamana, high o’er man yoked the Sun's courser EtaśaTo travel through the realm of air. And those ten Coursers, tawny-hued, he harnessed that the Sun might comeIndu, he said, is Indra's self. Hence, singers, pour the gladdeningjuice to Vāyu and to Indra, pourThe drops upon the fleecy cloth. O Soma Pavamana, find wealth for us not to be assailed,Wealth which the foeman may not win. Send riches hither with thy stream in thousands, both of steeds and kine,Send spoil of war and high renown. Soma the God, expressed with stones, like Sūrya, floweth on his way,Pouring the juice within the jar. These brilliant drops have poured for us, in stream of solemn sacrifice,Worshipful laws and strength in kine. Over the cleansing sieve have flowed the Somas, blent with curdled milk,Effused for Indra Thunder-armed. Soma, do thou most rich in sweets, a gladdening drink most dear to Gods,Flow to the sieve to bring us wealth. For Indra, living men adorn the Tawny Courser in the streams, Indu, the giver of delight. Pour for us, Soma, wealth in gold, in horses and heroic sons,Bring hither strength in herds of kine. For Indra pour ye on the fleece him very sweet to taste, who longs.For battle as it were in war. The singers, seeking help, adorn the Sage who must be decked with songs:Loud bellowing the Steer comes on, The singers with their thoughts and hymns have, in the stream of sacrifice,Caused Soma, active Steer, to roar. God, working with mankind, flow on; to Indra go thy gladdening juice:To Vāyu mount as Law commands O Soma, Pavamana, thou pourest out wealth that brings renown:Enter the lake, as one we love. Soma thou flowest chasing foes and bringing wisdom and delight:Drive off the folk who love not Gods. The Pavamanas have been poured, the brilliant drops of Soma juice,For holy lore of every kind. The Pavamanas have been shed, the beautiful swift Soma-drops,Driving all enemies afar. From, heaven, from out the firmament, hath Pavamana been effusedUpon the summit of the earth. O Soma, Indu, very wise, drive, being purified, with thy streamAll foes, all Rākṣasas away. Driving the Rākṣasas afar, O Soma, bellowing, pour for usMost excellent and splendid strength. Soma, do thou secure for us the treasures of the earih and heaven,Indu, all boons to be desired.
