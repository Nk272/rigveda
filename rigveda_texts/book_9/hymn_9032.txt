==================================================

. THE rapture-shedding Soma-drops, effused in our assembly, haveFlowed forth to glorify our prince. Then Trita's Maidens onward urge the Tawny-coloured with the stones,Indu for Indra, for his drink. Now like a swan he maketh all the company sing each his hymn:He, like a steed, is bathed in milk. O Soma, viewing heaven and earth, thou runncst like a darting deerSet in the place of sacrifice. The cows have sung with joy to him, even as a woman to her loveHe came as to a settled race. Bestow illustrious fame on us, both on our liberal lords and me,Glory, intelligence, and wealth.
