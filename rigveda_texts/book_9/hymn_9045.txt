We balm thee, red of hue, with milk to fit thee for the rapturous joy:Unbar for us the doors of wealth. He through the sieve hath passed, as comes a courser to the pole, to runIndu belongs unto the Gods. All friends have lauded him as he sports in the wood, beyond the fleece:Singers have chanted Indu's praise. Flow, Indu, with that stream wherein steeped thou announcest to the manWho worships thee heroic strength.
