==================================================

. ENGENDERING the Sun in floods, engendering heaven's lights, green-hued,Robed in the waters and the milk, According to primeval plan this Soma, with his stream, effusedFlows purely on, a God for Gods. For him victorious, waxen great, the juices with a thousand powersAre purified for winning spoil. Shedding the ancient fluid he is poured into the cleansing sieve:He, thundering, hath produced the Gods. Soma, while purifying, sends hither all things to be desired,He sends the Gods who strengthen Law. Soma, effused, pour on us wealth in kine, in heroes, steeds, and spoil,Send us abundant store of food.
