==================================================

. GREAT as he was, Soma hath gained strength by this high solemnity:joyous he riseth like a bull. His task is done: his crushings of the Dasyus are made manifest:He sternly reckoneth their debts. Soon as his song of praise is born, the Soma, Indra's juice, becomesA thousand-winning thunderbolt. Seer and Sustainer, he himself desireth riches for the sageWhen he embellisheth his songs. Fain would they both win riches as in races of the steeds. In warThou art upon the conquerors' side.
