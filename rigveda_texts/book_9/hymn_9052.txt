==================================================

. WEALTH-WINNER, dwelling in the sky, bringing us vigour with the juice,Flow to the filter when effused. So, in thine ancient ways, may he, beloved, with a thousand streamsRun oâ€™er the fleecy straining-cloth. Him who is like a caldron shake: O Indu, shake thy gift to usShake it, armed Warrior! with thine arms. Indu, invoked with many a prayer, bring down the vigour of these men,Of him who threatens us with war. Indu, Wealth-giver, with thine help pour out for us a hundred, yea,A thousand of thy pure bright streams.
