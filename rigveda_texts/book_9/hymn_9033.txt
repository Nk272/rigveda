==================================================

. LIKE waves of waters, skilled in song the juices of the Soma speedOnward, as buffaloes to woods. With stream of sacrifice the brown bright drops have flowed with strength in storeOf kine into the wooden vats. To Indra, Vāyu, Varuṇa, to Viṣṇu, and the Maruts, flowThe drops of Soma juice effused. Three several words are uttered: kine are ]owing, cows who give their milk:The Tawny-hued goes bellowing on. The young and sacred mothers of the holy rite have uttered praise:They decorate the Child of Heaven. From every side, O Soma, for our profit, pour thou forth four seasFilled full of riches thousandfold.
