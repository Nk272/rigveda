==================================================

. MAY Savitar the God, O Stones, stir you according to the Law:Be harnessed to the shafts, and press. Stones, drive calamity away, drive ye away malevolence:Make ye the Cows our medicine. Of one accord the upper Stones, giving the Bull his bull-like strength,Look down with pride on those below. May Savitar the God, O Stones, stir you as Law commands for himWho sacrifices, pouring juice.
