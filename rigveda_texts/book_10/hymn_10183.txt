==================================================

. I SAW thee meditating in thy spirit what sprang from Fervour and hath thence developed.Bestowing offspring here, bestowing riches, spread in thine offspring, thou who cravest children. I saw thee pondering in thine heart, and praying that in due time thy body might be fruitful.Come as a youthful woman, rise to meet me: spread in thine offspring, thou who cravest children. In plants and herbs, in all existent beings I have deposited the germ of increase.All progeny on earth have I engendered, and sons in women who will be hereafter.
