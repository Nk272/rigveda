==================================================

. WITH offering for success in fight whence Indra was victorious.With this, O Brahmaṇaspati, let us attain to royal sway. Subduing those who rival us, subduing all malignities,Withstand the man who menaces, withstand the man who angers us. Soma and Savitar the God have made thee a victorious KingAll elements have aided thee, to make thee general conqueror. Oblation, that which Indra. gave and thus grew glorious and most high,—This have I offered, Gods! and hence now, verily, am rivalless. Slayer of rivals, rivalless, victorious, with royal sway,Over these beings may I rule, may I be Sovran of the folk.
