==================================================

. Ye by your hymns are like high-thoughted singers, skilful, inviting Gods with sacrifices;Fair to behold, like Kings, with bright adornment, like spotless gallants, leaders of the people: Like fire with flashing flame, breast-bound with chains of gold, like tempest-blasts, self-moving, swift to lend your aid;As best of all foreknowers, excellent to guide, like Somas, good to guard the man who follows Law. Shakers of all, like gales of wind they travel, like tongues of burning fires in their effulgence.Mighty are they as warriors clad in armour, and, like the Fathers' prayers, Most Bounteous Givers. Like spokes of car-wheels in one nave united, ever victorious like heavenly Heroes,Shedding their precious balm like youthful suitors, they raise their voice and chant their psalm as singers. They who are fleet to travel like the noblest steeds, long to obtain the prize like bounteous charioteers,Like waters speeding on with their precipitous floods, like omniform Aṅgirases with Sāma-hymns. Born from the stream, like press-stones are the Princes, for ever like the stones that crush in pieces;Sons of a beauteous Dame, like playful children, like a great host upon the march with splendour. Like rays of Dawn, the visitors of sacrifice, they shine with ornaments as eager to be bright.Like rivers hasting on, glittering with their spears, from far away they measure out the distances. Gods, send us happiness and make us wealthy, letting us singers prosper, O ye Maruts.Bethink you of our praise and of our friendship: ye from of old have riches to vouchsafe us.
