==================================================

. THIS deathless Indu, like a steed, strong and of full vitality,Belongs to thee, the Orderer. Here, by us, for the worshipper, is the wise bolt that works with skill.It brings the bubbling beverage as a dexterous man brings the effectual strong drink. Impetuous Ahīśuva, a bull among cows of his,looked down upon the restless Hawk. That the strong-pinioned Bird hath brought, Child of the Falcon, from afar,What moves upon a hundred wheels along the female Dragon's path. Which, fair, unrobbed, the Falcon brought thee in his foot, the red-hued dwelling of the juice;Through this came vital power which lengthens out our days, and kinship through its help awoke. So Indra is by lndu's power; e’en among Gods will it repel great treachery.Wisdom, Most Sapient One, brings force that lengthens life. May wisdom bring the juice to us.
