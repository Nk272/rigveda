==================================================

. THIS very mighty one whom Gods commission, the Conqueror of cars, ever triumphant,Swift, fleet to battle, with uninjured fellies, even Tārkṣya for our weal will we call hither. As though we offered up our gifts to Indra, may we ascend. him as a ship. for safety.Like the two wide worlds, broad, deep far-extended, may we be safe both when he comes and leaves you. He who with might the Five Lands hath pervaded, like Sūrya with his lustre, and the waters—His strength wins hundreds, thousands none avert it, as the young maid repelleth not her lover.
