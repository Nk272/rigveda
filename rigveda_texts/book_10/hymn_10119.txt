==================================================

. THIS, even this was my resolve, to win a cow, to win a steed:Have I not drunk of Soma juice? Like violent gusts of wind the draughts that I have drunk have lifted meHave I not drunk of Soma juice? The draughts I drank have borne me up, as fleet-foot horses draw a car:Have I not drunk of Soma juice? The hymn hath reached me, like a cow who lows to meet her darling calf:Have I not drunk of Soma juice? As a wright bends a chariot-seat so round my heart I bend the hymn:Have I not drunk of Soma juice? Not as a mote within the eye count the Five Tribes of men with me:Have I not drunk of Soma juice? The heavens and earth themselves have not grown equal to one half of meHave I not drunk of Soma juice? I in my grandeur have surpassed the heavens and all this spacious earthHave I not drunk of Soma juice? Aha! this spacious earth will I deposit either here or thereHave I not drunk of Soma juice? In one short moment will I smite the earth in fury here or there:Have I not drunk of Soma juice? One of my flanks is in the sky; I let the other trail below:Have I not drunk of Soma juice?, greatest of the Mighty Ones, am lifted to the firmament:Have I not drunk of Soma juice? I seek the worshipper's abode; oblation-bearer to the Gods:Have I not drunk of Soma juice?
