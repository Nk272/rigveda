==================================================

. TURN, go not farther on your way: visit us, O ye Wealthy Ones.Agni and Soma, ye who bring riches again, secure us wealth. Make these return to us again, bring them beside us once again.May. Indra give them back to us, and Agni drive them hither-ward. Let them return to us again: under this herdsman let them feed.Do thou, O Agni, keep them here, and let the wealth we have remain. call upon their herdsman, him who knoweth well their coming nigh,Their parting and their home-return, and watcheth their approach and rest. Yea, let the herdsman, too, return, who marketh well their driving-forth;Marketh their wandering away, their turning back and coming home. Home-leader, lead them home to us; Indra, restore to us our kine:We will rejoice in them alive. offer you on every side butter and milk and strengthening food.May all the Holy Deities pour down on us a flood of wealth. O thou Home-leader, lead them home, restore them thou who bringest home.Four are the quarters of the earth; from these bring back to us our kine,
