==================================================

. HE with the long loose locks supports Agni, and moisture, heaven, and earth:He is all sky to look upon: he with long hair is called this light. The Munis, girdled with the wind, wear garments soiled of yellow hue.They, following the wind's swift course go where the Gods have gone before. Transported with our Munihood we have pressed on into the winds:You therefore, mortal men. behold our natural bodies and no more. The Muni, made associate in the holy work of every God,Looking upon all varied forms flies through the region of the air. The Steed of Vāta, Vāyu's friend, the Muni, by the Gods impelled,In both the oceans hath his home, in eastern and in western sea. Treading the path of sylvan beasts, Gandharvas, and Apsarases,He with long locks, who knows the wish, is a sweet most delightful friend Vāyu hath churned for him: for him he poundeth things most hard to bend,When he with long loose locks hath drunk, with Rudra, water from the cup.
