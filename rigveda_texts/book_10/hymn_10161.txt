==================================================

. FOR life I set thee free by this oblation from the unknown decline and from Consumption;Or, if the grasping demon have possessed him, free him from her, O Indra, thou and Agni. Be his days ended, be he now departed, be he brought very near to death already,Out of Destruction's lap again I bring him, save him for life to last a hundred autumns. With hundred-eyed oblation, hundred-autumned, bringing a hundred lives, have I restored him,That Indra for a hundred years may lead him safe to the farther shore of all misfortune. Live, waxing in thy strength, a hundred autumns, live through a hundred springs, a hundred winters.Through hundred-lived oblation Indra, Agni, Bá¹›haspati, Savitar yield him for a hundred! So have I found and rescued thee thou hast returned with youth renewed.Whole in thy members! I have found thy sight and all thy life for thee.
