==================================================

. FOR Iṭa's sake who pressed the juice, thou, Indra, didst protect his car,And hear the Soma-giver's call. Thou from his skin hast borne the head of the swift-moving combatant,And sought the Soma-pourer's home. Venya, that mortal man, hast thou, for Āstrabudhna the devout,O Indra, many a time set free. Bring, Indra, to the east again that Sun who now is in the west,Even against the will of Gods.
