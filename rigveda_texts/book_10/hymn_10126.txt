==================================================

. No peril, no severe distress, ye Gods, affects the mortal man,Whom Aryaman and Mitra lead, and Varima, of one accord, beyond his foes. This very thing do we desire, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,Whereby ye guhrd the mortal man from sore distress, and lead him safe beyond his foes. These are, each one, our present helps, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.Best leaders, best deliverers to lead us on and bear as safe beyond our foes. Ye compass round and guard each man, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman:In your dear keeping may we be, ye who are excellent as guides beyond our foes. Ādityas are beyond all foes,—Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman:Strong Rudra with the Marut host, Indra, Agni let us call for weal beyond our foes. These lead us safely over all, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,These who are Kings of living men, over all troubles far away beyond our foes. May they give bliss to aid us well, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman:May the Ādityas, when we pray, grant us wide shelter and defence beyond our foes. As in this place, O Holy Ones, ye Vasus freed even the Gaud when her feet were fettered.So free us now from trouble and affliction: and let our life be lengthened still, O Api.
