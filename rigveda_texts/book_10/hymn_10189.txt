==================================================

. THIS spotted Bull hath come, and sat before the Mother in the east,Advancing to his Father heaven. Expiring when he draws his breath, she moves along the lucid spheres:The Bull shines out through all the sky. Song is bestowed upon the Bird: it rules supreme through thirty realmsThroughout the days at break of morn.
