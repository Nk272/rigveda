==================================================

. A MIGHTY Governor art thou, Wondrous, Destroyer of the foe,Whose friend is never done to death, and never, never overcome. Lord of the clan, who brings us bliss, Strong, Warrior, Slayer of the fiend,May India, Soma-drinker, go before us, Bull who gives us peace. Drive Rākṣasas and foes away, break thou in pieces Vṛtra'sjaws:O Vṛtra-slaying Indra, quell the foeman's wrath who threatens us. O Indra, beat our foes away, humble the men who challenge us:Send down to nether darkness him who seeks to do us injury. Baffle the foeman's plan, ward off his weapon who would conquer us.Give shelter from his furious wrath, and keep his murdering dart afar.
