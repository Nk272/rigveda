. FROM Fervour kindled to its height Eternal Law and Truth were born:Thence was the Night produced, and thence the billowy flood of sea arose. From that same billowy flood of sea the Year was afterwards produced,Ordainer of the days nights, Lord over all who close the eye. DhƒÅtar, the great Creator, then formed in due order Sun and Moon.He formed in order Heaven and Earth, the regions of the air, and light.
