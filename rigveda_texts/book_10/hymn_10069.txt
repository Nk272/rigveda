==================================================

. Auspicious is the aspect of Vadhryasva's fire good is its guidance, pleasant are its visitings.When first the people Of Sumitra kindle it, with butter poured thercon it crackles and shines bright. Butter is that which makes Vadhryaiva's fire growstrong: the butter is its food, the butter makes it fat.It spreads abroad when butter hath been offered it, and balmed with streams of butter shines forth like the Sun. Still newest is this face of thine, O Agni, which Manu and Sumitra have enkindled.So richly shine, accept our songs with favour, so give us strengthening food, so send us glory. Accept this offering, Agni, whom aforetime Vadhryasva, hath entreated and enkindled.Guard well our homes and ople, guard our bodies, protect thy girt to us which thou hast granted. Be splendid, guard us Kinsman of Vadhryasva: let not the enmity of men o’ercome thee,Like the bold hero Cyavāna, I Sumitra tell forth the title of Vadhryaiva's Kinsman. All treasures hast thou won, of plains and mountains, and quelled the Dāsas' and Āryas' hatred.Like the bold hero Cyavāna, O Agni, mayst thou subdue the men who long for battle. Deft Agni hath a lengthened thread, tall oxen, a thousand heifers, numberless devices.Decked by the men, splendid among the splendid, shine brightly forth amid devout Sumitras. Thine is the teeming cow, O Jātavedas, who pours at once her ceaseless flow, Sabardhuk,Thou. art lit up by men enriched with guerdon, O Agni, by the pious-souled Sumitras. Even Immortal Gods, O Jātavedas, Vadhryasva's Kinsman, have declared thy grandeur.When human tribes drew near with supplication thou conqueredst with men whom thou hadst strengthened. Like as a father bears his son, O Agni, Vadhryasva bare thee in his lap and served thee.Thou, Youngest God, having enjoyed his fuel, didst vanquish those of old though they were mighty. Vadhryasva's Agni evermore hath vanquished his foes with heroes who had pressed the Soma.Lord of bright rays, thou burntest up the battle, subduing, as our help, e’en mighty foemen. This Agni of Vadhryasva, Vṛtra-slayer, lit from of old, must be invoked with homage.As such assail our enemies, Vadhryasva, whether the foes be strangers or be kinsmen.
