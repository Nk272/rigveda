==================================================

. MAY S큰rya guard us out of heaven, and V훮ta from the firmament,And Agni from terrestrial spots. Thou Savitar whose flame deserves hundred libations, be thou pleased:From failing lightning keep us safe. May Savitar the God, and may Parvata also give us sight;May the Creator give us sight. Give sight unto our eye, give thou our bodies sight that they may see:May we survey, discern this world. Thus, S큰rya, may we look on thee, on thee most lovely to behold,See clearly with the eyes of men.
