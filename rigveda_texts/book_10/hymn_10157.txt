==================================================

. WE will, with Indra and all Gods to aid us, bring these existing worlds into subjection. Our sacrifice, our bodies, and our offspr. let Indra form together with Ādityas. With the Ādityas, with the band of Maruts, may Indra be Protector of our bodies. As when the Gods came, after they had slaughtered the Asuras, keeping safe their Godlike nature, Brought the Sun hitherward with mighty powers, and looked about them on their vigorous Godhead.
