==================================================

. BE with us; I have chosen thee: stand stedfast and immovable.Let all the people wish for thee let not thy kingship fall away. Be even here; fall not away be like a mountain unremoved.Stand stedfast here like Indra's self, and hold the kingship in the grasp. This man hath Indra stablished, made secure by strong oblation's power.May Soma speak a benison, and Brahmaṇaspati, on him. Firm is the sky and firm the earth, and stedfast also are these hills.Stedfast is all this living world, and stedfast is this King of men. Stedfast, may Varuṇa the King, stedfast, the God Bṛhaspati,Stedfast, may Indra, stedfast too, may Agni keep thy stedfast reign. On constant Soma let us think with constant sacrificial giftAnd then may Indra make the clans bring tribute unto thee alone.
