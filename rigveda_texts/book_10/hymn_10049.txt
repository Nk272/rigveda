==================================================

. I HAVE enriched the singer with surpassing wealth; I have allowed the holy hymn to strengthen me.I, furtherer of him who offers sacrifice, have conquered in each fight the men who worship not. The People of the heavens, the waters, and the earth have stablished me among the Gods with Indra's name.I took unto myself the two swift vigorous Bays that speed on divers paths, and the fierce bolt for strength. With deadly blows I smote Atka for Kavi's sake; I guarded Kutsa well with these saving helps.As Śuṣṇa's slayer I brandished the dart of death: I gave not up the Āryan name to Dasyu foes. Smadibha, Tugra, and the Vetasus I gave as prey to Kutsa, father-like, to succour him.I was a worthy King to rule the worshipper, when I gave Tuji dear inviolable gifts. I gave up Mṛgaya to Srutarvan as his prey because he ever followed me and kept my laws.For Āyu's sake I caused Veta to bend and bow, and into Savya's hand delivered Padgrbhi., I crushed Navavāstva of the lofty car, the Dāsa, as the Vṛtra-slayer kills the fiends;When straightway on the region's farthest edge I brought the God who makes the lights to broaden and increase. I travel round about borne onward in my might by the fleet-footed dappled Horses of the Sun.When man's libation calls me to the robe of state I soon repel the powerful Dasyu with my blows. Stronger am I than Nabus, I who slew the seven: I glorified with might Yadu and Turvaga.I brought another low, with strength I bent his strength: I let the mighty nine-and-ninety wax in power. Bull over all the streams that flow along the earth, I took the Seven Rivers as mine own domain.I, gifted with great wisdom, spread the floods abroad: by war I found for man the way to high success. I set within these cows the white milk which no God, not even Tvaṣṭar's self, had there deposited,—Much-longed-for, in the breasts, the udders of the kine, the savoury sweets of meath, the milk and Soma juice. Even thus hath Indra Maghavan, truly bounteous, sped Gods and men with mighty operation.The pious glorify all these thine exploits, Lord of Bay Coursers, Strong, and Selfresplendent.
