==================================================

. WITH offerings of our own we choose thee, Agni, as Invoking Priest,For sacrifice with trimmed grass,—at your glad carouse-piercing and brightly shining. Thou art waxing great. The wealthy ones adorn thee, they who bring us horses as their gift:The sprinkling ladle, Agni,—at your glad carouse -and glowing offering taste thee. Thou art waxing great. The holy statutes rest by thee, as ’twere with ladles that o’erflow.Black and white-gleaming colours,—at your glad carouse-all glories thou assurnest. Thou art waxing great. O Agni, what thou deemest wealth, Victorious and Immortal One!Bring thou to give us vigour,—at your glad carouse -splendid at sacrifices. Thou art waxing great. Skilled in all lore is Agni, he whom erst Atharvan brought to life.He was Vivasvān's envoy, at your glad carouse-the weIl-loved friend of Yama, Thou art waxing great. At sacrifices they adore thee, Agni, when the rite proceeds.All fair and lovely treasures-at your glad carouse-thou givest him who offers. Thou art waxing great. Men, Agni, have established thee as welcome Priest at holy rites,Thee whose face shines with butter,—at your glad carouse-bright, with eyes most observant. Thou art waxing great. Wide and aloft thou spreadest thee, O Agni, with thy brilliant flame.A Bull art thou when bellowing,—at your glad carouse-thou dost impregn the Sisters. Thou art waxing great.
