==================================================

. YE, who, adorned with guerdon through the sacrifice, have won you Indra's friendship and eternal life,Even to you be happiness, Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise. The Fathers, who drave forth the wealth in cattle, have in the year's courses cleft Vala by Eternal Law:A lengthened life be yours, O ye Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise. Ye raised the Sun to heaven by everlasting Law, and spread broad earth, the Mother, out on every side.Fair wealth of progeny be yours, Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise. This kinsman in your dwellingplace speaks pleasant words: give car to this, ye Ṛṣis, children of the Gods.High Brahman dignity be yours, Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise. Distinguished by their varied form, these Ṛṣis have been deeply moved.These are the sons of Aṅgirases: from Agni have they sprung to life. Distinguished by their varied form, they sprang from Agni, from the sky.Navagva and Daśagva, noblest Aṅgiras, he giveth bounty with the Gods. With Indra for associate the priests have cleared the stable full of steeds and kine,Giving to me a thousand with their eightmarked cars, they gained renown among the Gods. May this man's sons be multiplied; like springing corn may Manu grow,Who gives at once in bounteous gift a thousand kine, a hundred steeds. No one attains to him, as though a man would grasp the heights of heaven.Savarnya's sacrificial meed hath broadened like an ample flood. Yadu and Turva, too, have given two Dāsas, well-disposed, to serve,Together with great store of kine. Blest be the hamlet's chief, most liberal Manu, and may his bounty rival that of Sūrya.May the God let Ssvarni's life be lengthened, with whom, unwearied, we have lived and prospered.
