==================================================

. O INDRA, hear us. Raining down the Soma, we call on thee to win us mighty valour.Give us strong succour on the day of trial, when the tribes gather on the field of battle. The warrior, son of warrior sire, invokes thee, to gain great strength that may be won as booty:To thee, the brave man's Lord, the fiends' subduer, he looks when fighting hand to hand for cattle. Thou didst impel the sage to win the daylight, didst ruin Śuṣṇa for the pious Kutsa.The invulnerable demon's head thou clavest when thou wouldst win the praise of Atithigva. The lofty battle-car thou broughtest forward; thou holpest Dasadyu the strong when fighting.Along with Vetasu thou slewest Tugra, and madest Tuji strong, who praised thee, Indra. Thou madest good the laud, what time thou rentest a hundred thousand fighting foes, O Hero,Slewest the Dāsa Śambara of the mountain, and with strange aids didst succour Divodāsa. Made glad with Soma-draughts and faith, thou sentest Cumuri to his sleep, to please Dabhīti.Thou, kindly giving Raji to Pithinas, slewest with might, at once, the sixty thousand. May I too, with the liberal chiefs, O Indra, acquire thy blin supreme and domination,When, Mightiest! Hero-girt! Nahuṣa heroes boast them in thee, the triply-strong Defender. So may we he thy friends, thy best beloved, O Indra, at this holy invocation.Best be Pratardani, illustrious ruler, in slaying foemen and in gaining riches.
