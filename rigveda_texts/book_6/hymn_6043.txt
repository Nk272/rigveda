==================================================

. IN whose wild joy thou madest once Śambara Divodāsa's prey,This Soma is pressed out for thee, O Indra: drink! Whose gladdening draught, shed from the points, thou guardest in the midst and end,This Soma is pressed out for thee, O Indra drink! In whose wild joy thou settest free the kine held fast within the rock,This Soma is pressed out for thee, O Indra: drink! This, in whose juice delighting thou gainest the might of Maghavan,This Soma is pressed out for thee, O Indra drink!
