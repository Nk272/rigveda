==================================================

. SERVED with oblations, first-born, mountain-render, Aṅgiras' son, Bṛhaspati, the Holy,With twice-firm path, dwelling in light, our Father, roars loudly, as a bull, to Earth and Heaven. Bṛhaspati, who made for such a people wide room and verge when Gods were invocated,Slaying his enemies, breaks down their castles, quelling his foes and conquering those who hate him. Bṛhaspati in war hath won rich treasures, hath won, this God, the great stalls filled with cattle.Striving to win waters and light, resistless, Bṛhaspati with lightning smites the foeman.
