==================================================

. THE radiant Dawns have risen up for glory, in their white splendour like the waves of waters.She maketh paths all easy, fair to travel, and, rich, hath shown herself benign and friendly. We see that thou art good: far shines thy lustre; thy beams, thy splendours have flown up to heaven.Decking thyself, thou makest bare thy bosom, shining in majesty, thou Goddess Morning. Red are the kine and luminous that bear her the Blessed One who spreadeth through the distance.The foes she chaseth like a valiant archer, like a swift warrior she repelleth darkness. Thy ways are easy on the hills: thou passest Invincible! Sef-luminous! through waters.So lofty Goddess with thine ample pathway, Daughter of Heaven, bring wealth to give us comfort. Dawn, bring me wealth: untroubled, with thine oxen thou bearest riches at thy will and pleasure;Thou who, a Goddess, Child of Heaven, hast shown thee lovely through bounty when we called thee early. As the birds fly forth from their restingplaces, so men with store of food rise at thy dawning.Yea, to the liberal mortal who rernaineth at home, O Goddess Dawn, much good thou bringest.
