==================================================

. INSTALL at sacrifice, while the rite advances, your pleasant, heavenly Agni, meet for praises.With hymns-for he illumines us-install him. He, Jātavedas, makes our rites successful. Hear this laud, Radiant Priest of many aspects, O Agni with the fires of man enkindled,Laud which bards send forth pure as sacred butter, strength to this man, as ’twere for self-advantage. Mid mortal men that singer thrives in glory who offers gifts with hymns of praise to Agni,And the God, wondrous bright, with wondrous succours helps him to win a stable filled with cattle. He, at his birth, whose path is black behind him, filled heaven and earth with far-apparent splendour:And he himself hath been. through night's thick darkness, made manifest by light, the Purifier. With thy most mighty aid, confer, O Agni, wonderful wealth on us and on our princes,Who stand preeminent, surpassing others in liberal gifts, in fame, and hero virtues. Agni, accept this sacrifice with gladness, which, seated here, the worshipper presenteth.Fair hymns hadst thou among the Bharadvājas, and holpest them to gain abundant vigour. Scatter our foes, increase our store. May we he glad a hundred winters with brave sons.
