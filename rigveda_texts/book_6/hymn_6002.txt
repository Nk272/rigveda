==================================================

. THOU, Agni, even as Mitra, hast a princely glory of thine own.Thou, active Vasu, makest fame increase like full prosperity. For, verily, men pray to thee with sacrifices and with songs.To thee the Friendly Courser, seen of all, comes speeding through the air. Of one accord men kindle thee Heaven's signal of the sacrifice,When, craving bliss, this race of man invites thee to the solemn rite. Let the man thrive who travails sore, in prayer, far thee the Bountiful.He with the help of lofty Dyaus comes safe through straits of enmity. The mortal who with fuel lights thy flame and offers unto thee,Supports a house with many a branch, Agni, to live a hundred years. Thy bright smoke lifts itself aloft, and far-extended shines in heaven.For, Purifier! like the Sun thou beamest with thy radiant glow. For in men's houses thou must be glorified as a well-loved guest,Gay like an elder in a fort, claiming protection like a son. Thou, Agni, like an able steed, art urged by wisdom in the wood.Thou art like wind; food, home art thou, like a young horse that runs astray. E’en things imperishable, thou, O Agni, like a gazing ox,Eatest, when hosts, Eternal One! of thee the Mighty rend the woods. Agni, thou enterest as Priest the home of men who sacrifice.Lord of the people, prosper them. Accept the ofrering, Aṅgiras! O Agni, God with Mitra's might, call hither the favour of the Gods from earth and heaven.Bring weal from heaven, that men may dwell securely. May we o’ercome the foe's malign oppressions, may we o’ercome them, through thy help o’ercome them.
