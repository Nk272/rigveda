==================================================

. BRING sacrificial gifts to him, Omniscient, for he longs to drink,The Wanderer who comes with speed, the Hero ever in the van. With Soma go ye nigh to him chief drinker of the Soma's juice:With beakers to the Impetuous God, to Indra with the drops effused. What time, with Soma, with the juice effused, ye come before the God,Full wise he knows the hope of each, and, Bold One, strikes this foe and that. To him, Adhvaryu! yea, to him give offerings of the juice expressed.Will he not keep us safely from the spiteful curse of each presumptuous high-born foe?
