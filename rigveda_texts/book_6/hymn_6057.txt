==================================================

. INDRA and Pūṣan will we call for friend ship and prosperityAnd for the winning of the spoil. One by the Soma sits to drink juice which the mortar hath expressed:The other longs for curd and meal. Goats are the team that draws the one: the other hath Bay Steeds at hand;With both of these he slays the fiends. When Indra, wondrous strong, brought down the streams, the mighty waterfloods,Pūṣan was standing by his side. To this, to Pūṣan's favouring love, and Indra's, may we closely cling,As to a tree's extended bough. As one who drives a car draws in his reins, may we draw Pūṣan near,And Indra, for our great success.
