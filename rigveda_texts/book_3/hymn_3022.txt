==================================================

 THIS is that Agni whence the longing Indra took the pressed Soma deep within his body.Winner of spoils in thousands, like a courser, with praise art thou exalted, JƒÅtavedas. That light of thine in heaven and earth, O Agni, in plants, O Holy One, and in the waters,Wherewith thou hast spread wide the air's mid-region-bright is that splendour, wavy, man-beholding. O Agni, to the sea of heaven thou goest: thou hast called hither Gods beheld in spirit.The waters, too, come hither, those up yonder in the Sun's realm of light, and those beneath it. Let fires that dwell in mist, combined with those that have their home in floods,Guileless accept our sacrifice, great viands free from all disease. Agni, as holy food to thine invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels.To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious will to us-ward.
