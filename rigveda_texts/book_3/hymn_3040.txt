Indra, whom many laud, accept the strength-conferring Soma juice:Quaff, pour down drink that satisfies. Indra, with all the Gods promote our wealth-bestowing sacrifice,Thou highly-lauded Lord of men. Lord of the brave, to thee proceed these drops of Soma juice expressed,The bright drops to thy dwelling-place. Within thy belly, Indra, take juice, Soma the most excellent: Thine are the drops celestial. Drink our libation, Lord of hymns: with streams of meath thou art bedewedOur glory, Indra, is thy gift. To Indra go the treasures of the worshipper, which never fail:He drinks the Soma and is strong From far away, from near at hand, O Vá¹›tra-slayer, come to us:Accept the songs we sing to thee. When from the space between the near and far thou art invoked by us,Thence, Indra. come thou hitherward.
