==================================================

. AGNI who knowest all, accept our offering and the cake of meal,At dawn's libation, rich in prayer! Agni, the sacrificial cake hath been prepared and dressed for thee:Accept it, O Most Youthful God. Agni, enjoy the cake of meal and our oblation three days old:Thou, Son of Strength, art stablished at our sacrifice. Here at the midday sacrifice enjoy thou the sacrificial cake, wise, JƒÅtavedas!Agni, the sages in assemblies never minish the portion due to thee the Mighty. O Agni, at the third libation takewith joy the offered cake of sacrifice, thou, Son of Strength.Through skill in song bear to the Gods our sacrifice, watchful and fraught with riches, to Immortal God. O waxing Agni, knower, thou, of all, accept our gifts, the cake,And that prepared ere yesterday.
