==================================================

. AGNI is Priest, the great High Priest of sacrifice, most swift in act:He knows the rite in constant course. Oblation-bearer, deathless, well inclined, an eager messenger,Agni comes nigh us with the thought. Ensign of sacrifice from of old, Agni well knoweth with his thoughtTo prosper this man's aim and hope. Agni, illustrious from old time, the Son of Strength who knows all life,The Gods have made to their Priest. Infallible is Agni, he who goes before the tribes of men,A chariot swift and ever new. Strength of the Gods which none may harm, subduing all his enemies,Agni is mightiest in fame. By offering sacred food to him the mortal worshipper obtains.A home from him whose light makes pure. From Agni, by our hymns, may we gain all things that bring happiness,Singers of him who knows all life. O Agni, in our deeds of might may we obtain all precious things:Tle Gods are centred all in thee.
