==================================================

. THEE Agni, God, Imperial Lord of all mankind, do mortal menWith understanding kindle at the sacrifice. They laud thee in their solemn rites, Agni, as Minister and Priest,Shine forth in thine own home as guardian of the Law. He, verily, who honours thee with fuel, Knower of all life,He, Agni! wins heroic might, he prospers well. Ensign of sacrifices, he, Agni, with Gods is come to us,Decked by the seven priests, to him who bringeth gifts. To Agni, the Invoking Priest, offer your best, your lofty speech,To him Ordainer-like who brings the light of songs. Let these our hymns make Agni grow, whence, meet for laud, he springs to life,To mighty strength and great possession, fair to see. Best Sacrificer, bring the Gods, O Agni, to the pious man:A joyful Priest, thy splendour drive our foes afar As such, O Purifier, shine on us heroic glorious might:Be nearest Friend to those who laud thee, for their weal. So, wakeful, versed in sacred hymns, the holy singers kindly thee.Oblation-bearer, deathless, cherisher of strength.
