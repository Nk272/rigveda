==================================================

. DULY enkindled after ancient customs, bringing all treasures, he is balmed with unguents,—Flame-haired, oil-clad, the purifying Agni, skilled in fair rites, to bring the Gods for worship. As thou, O Agni, skilful Jātavedas, hast sacrificed as Priest of Earth, of Heaven,So with this offering bring the Gods, and prosper this sacrifice today as erst for Manu. Three are thy times of life, O Jātavedas, and the three mornings are thy births, O Agni.With these, well-knowing, grant the Gods’ kind favour, and help in stir and stress the man who worships. Agni most bright and fair with song we honour, yea, the adorable, O Jātavedas.Thee, envoy, messenger, oblation-bearer, the Gods have made centre of life eternal. That Priest before thee, yet more skilled in worship, stablished of old, health-giver by his nature,—After his custom offer, thou who knowest, and lay our sacrifice where Gods may taste it.
