==================================================

. MOUNTED upon thy chariot-seat approach us: thine is the Soma-draught from days aforetime.Loose for the sacred grass thy dear companions. These men who bring oblation call thee hither. Come our true Friend, passing by many people; come with thy two Bay Steeds to our devotions;For these our hymns are calling thee, O Indra, hymns formed for praise, soliciting thy friendship. Pleased, with thy Bay Steeds, Indra, God, come quickly to this our sacrifice that heightens worship;For with my thoughts, presenting oil to feed thee, I call thee to the feast of sweet libations. Yea, let thy two Bay Stallions bear thee hither, well limbed and good to draw, thy dear companions.Pleased with the corn-blent offering which we bring thee, may Indra, Friend, hear his friend's adoration. Wilt thou not make me guardian of the people, make me, impetuous Maghavan, their ruler?Make me a Ṛṣi having drunk of Soma? Wilt thou not give me wealth that lasts for ever? Yoked to thy chariot, led thy tall Bays, Indra, companions of thy banquet, bear thee hither,Who from of old press to heaven's farthest limits, the Bull's impetuous and well-groomed Horses. Drink of the strong pressed out by strong ones, Indra, that which the Falcon brought thee when thou longedst;In whose wild joy thou stirrest up the people, in whose wild joy thou didst unbar the cow-stalls. Call we on Indra, Makhavan, auspicious, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered;The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.
