==================================================

. O Uṣas, strong with strength, endowed witli knowledge, accept the singer's praise, O wealthy Lady.Thou, Goddess, ancient, young, and full of wisdom, movest, all-bounteous! as the Law ordaineth. Shine forth, O Morning, thou auspicious Goddess, on thy bright car awaking pleasant voices.Let docile horses of far-reaching splendour convey thee hitherward, the goldencoloured. Thou, Morning, turning thee to every creature, standest on high as ensign of the Immortal,To one same goal ever and ever wending now, like a wheel, O newly-born, roll hi ther. Letting her reins drop downward, Morning cometh, the wealthy Dame, the Lady of the dwelling;Bringing forth light, the Wonderful, the Blessed hath spread her from the bounds of earth and heaven. Hither invoke the radiant Goddess Morning, and bring with reverence your hymn to praise her.She, dropping sweets, hath set in heaven her brightness, and, fair to look on, hath beamed forth her splendour. From heaven, with hymns, the Holy One was wakened: brightly to both worlds came the wealthy Lady.To Morning, Agni, when she comes refulgent, thou goest forth soliciting fair riches. On Law's firm base the speeder of the Mornings, the Bull, hath entered mighty earth and heaven.Great is the power of Varuṇa and Mitra, which, bright, hath spread in every place its splendour.
