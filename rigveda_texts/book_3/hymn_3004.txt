==================================================

. BE friendly with each kindled log of fuel, with every flash bestow the boon of riches.Bring thou the Gods, O God, unto our worship: serve, well-inclined, as Friend thy friends, O Agni. Agni whom daily Varuṇa and Mitra the Gods bring thrice a day to this our worship,Tanūnapāt, enrich with meath our service that dwells with holy oil, that offers honour. The thought that bringeth every boon proceedeth to worship first the Priest of the libation,That we may greet the Strong One with our homage. Urged, may he bring the Gods, best Sacrificer. On high your way to sacrifice was made ready; the radiant flames went upward to the regions.Full in the midst of heaven the Priest is seated: sirew we the sacred grass where Gods may rest them. Claiming in mind the seven priests' burntoblations, inciting all, they came in settled order.To this our sacrifice approach the many who show in hero beauty at assemblies. Night and Dawn, lauded, hither come together, both smiling, different are their forms in colour,That Varuṇa and Mitra may accept us, and Indra, girt by Maruts, with his glories.. I crave the grace of heaven's two chief Invokers: the seven swift steeds joy in their wonted manner.These speak of truth, praising the truth eternal, thinking on Order as the guards of Order. May Bhāratī with all her Sisters, Iḷā accordant with the Gods, with mortalls Agni,Sarasvatī with all her kindred Rivers, come to this grass, Three Goddesses, and seat them. Well pleased with us do thou O God, O Tvaṣṭar, give ready issue to our procreant vigour,Whence springs the hero, powerful, skilled in action, lover of Gods, adjuster of the press-stones. Send to the Gods the oblation, Lord of Forests; and let the Immolator, Agni, dress it.He as the truer Priest shall offer worship, for the Gods’ generations well he knoweth. Come thou to us, O Agni, duly kindled, together with the potent Gods and Indra.On this our grass sit Aditi, happy Mother, and let our Hail delight the Gods Immortal.
