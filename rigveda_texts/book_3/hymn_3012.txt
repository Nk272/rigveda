==================================================

. MOVED, Indra-Agni, by our hymn, come to the juice, the precious dew:Drink ye thereof, impelled by song. O Indra-Agni, with the man who lauds you comes the wakening rite:So drink ye both this juice assured. Through force of sacrifice I choose Indra-Agni who love the wise:With Soma let these sate them here. Indra and Agni I invoke, joint-victors, bounteous, unsubdued,Foe-slayers, best to win the spoil. Indra and Agni, singers skilled in melody hymn you, bringing lauds:I choose you for the sacred food. Indra and Agni, ye cast down the ninety forts which DƒÅsas held,Together, with one mighty deed. To Indra-Agni reverent thoughts go forward from the holy taskAlong the path of sacred Law. O Indra-Agni, powers are yours, and dwellings and delightful foodGood is your readiness to act. Indra and Agni, in your deeds of might ye deck heaven's lucid realms:Famed is that hero strength of yours.
