==================================================

. THE rich new car hath been equipped at morning; four yokes it hath, three whips, seven reins to guide it:Ten-sided, friendly to mankind, light-winner, that must be urged to speed with prayers and wishes. This is prepared for him the first, the second, and the third time: he is man's Priest and Herald.Others get offspring of another parent he goeth, as a noble Bull, with others. To Indra's car the Bay Steeds have I harnessed, that new well-spoken words may bring him hither.Here let not other worshippers detain thee, for among us are many holy singers. Indra, come hitherward with two Bay Coursers, come thou with four, with six when invocated.Come thou with eight, with ten, to drink the Soma. Here is the juice, brave Warrior: do not scorn it. O Indra, come thou hither having harnessed thy car with twenty, thirty, forty horses.Come thou with fifty well trained coursers, Indra, sixty or seventy, to drink the Soma. Come to us hitherward, O Indra, carried by eighty, ninety, or an hundred horses.This Soma juice among the Śunahotras hath been poured out, in love, to glad thee, Indra. To this my prayer, O Indra, come thou hither: bind to thy car's pole all thy two Bay Coursers.Thou art to be invoked in many places Hero, rejoice thyself in this libation. Ne’er be my love from Indra disunited still may his liberal Milch-cow yield us treasure.So may we under his supreme protection, safe in his arms, succeed in each forth-going. Now may that wealthy Cow Of thine, O Indra, give in return a boon to him who lauds thee.Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.
