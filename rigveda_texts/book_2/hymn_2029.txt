==================================================

. UPHOLDERS of the Law, ye strong Ādityas, remove my sin like her who bears in secret.You, Varuṇa, Mitra and all Gods who listen, I call to help me, I who know your goodness. Ye, Gods, are providence and ye are power: remove ye utterly all those who hate us.As givers of good things deal with us kindly: this day be gracious to us and hereafter. What service may we do you with our future, what service, Vasus, with our ancient friendship?O Aditi, and Varuṇa and Mitra, Indra and Maruts, make us well and happy. Ye, O ye Gods, are verily our kinsmen as such be kind to me who now implore you.Let not your car come slowly to our worship: of kinsmen such as you ne’er let us weary. I singly have sinned many a sin against you, and ye chastised me as a sire the gambler.Far be your nets, far, Gods, be mine offences: seize me not like a bird upon her offspring. Turn yourselves hitherward this day, ye Holy, that fearing in my heart I may approach you.Protect us, God; let not the wolf destroy us. Save us, ye Holy, from the pit and falling. May I not live, O Varuṇa, to witness my wealthy, liberal, dear friend's destitution.King, may I never lack well-ordered riches. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.
