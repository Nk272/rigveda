==================================================

. HERE on the right sing forth chanters of hymns of praise, even the winged birds that in due season speak.He, like: a Sāma-chanter utters both the notes, skilled in the mode of Tṛṣṭup and of Gāyatrī. Thou like the chanter-priest chantest the Sāma, Bird; thou singest at libations like a Brahman's son.Even as a vigorous horse when he comes near the mare, announce to us good fortune, Bird, on every side, proclaim in all directions happy luck, O Bird. When singing here, O Bird. announce good luck to us, and when thou sittest still think on us with kind thoughts.
