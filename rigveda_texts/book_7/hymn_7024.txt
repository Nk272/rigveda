==================================================

. A HOME is made for thee to dwell in, Indra: O Much-invoked, go thitherwith the heroes.That thou, to prosper us, mayst be our Helper, vouchsafe us wealth, rejoice with draughts of Soma. Indra, thy wish, twice-strong, is comprehended: pressed is the Soma, poured are pleasant juices.This hymn of praise, from loosened tongue, made perfect, draws Indra to itself with loud invoking. Come, thou Impetuous; God, from earth or heaven; come to our holy grass to drink the Soma.Hither to me let thy Bay Horses bring thee to listen to our hymns and make thee joyful. Come unto us with all thine aids, accordant, Lord of Bay Steeds, accepting our devotions,Fair-helmeted, o’ercoming with the mighty, and lending us the strength of bulls, O Indra. As to the chariot pole a vigorous courser, this laud is brought to the great strong Upholder.This hymn solicits wealth of thee: in heaven, as ’twere above the sky, set thou our glory. With precious things. O Indra, thus content us: may we attain to thine exalted favour.Send our chiefs plenteous food with hero children. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
