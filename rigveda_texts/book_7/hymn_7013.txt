==================================================

. BRING song and hymn to Agni, Asura-slayer, enlightener of all and thought-bestower.Like an oblation on the grass, to please him, I bring this to Vaiśvānara, hymn-inspirer. Thou with thy flame, O Agni, brightly glowing, hast at thy birth filled full the earth and heaven.TIOU with thy might, Vaiśvānara Jātavedas, settest the Gods free frodi the curse that bound them. Agni, when, born thou lookedst on all creatures, like a brisk herdsman moving round his cattle.The path to prayer, Vaiśvānara, thou foundest. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.
