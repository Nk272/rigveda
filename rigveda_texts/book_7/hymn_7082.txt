==================================================

. GRANT us your strong protection, IndraVaruṇa, our people, and our family, for sacrifice.May we subdue in fight our evil-hearted foes, him who attacks the man steadfast in lengthened rites. O Indra-Varuṇa, mighty and very rich One of you is called Monarch and One Autocrat.All Gods in the most lofty region of the air have, O ye Steers, combined all power and might in you. Ye with your strength have pierced the fountains of the floods: the Sun have ye brought forward as the Lord in heaven.Cheered by this magic draught ye, Indra-Varuṇa, made the dry places stream, made songs of praise flow forth. In battels and in frays we ministering priests, kneeling upon our knees for furtherance of our weal,Invoke you, only you, the Lords of twofold wealth, you prompt to hear, we bards, O Indra-Varuṇa. O Indra-Varuṇa, as ye created all these creatures of the world by your surpassing might,In peace and quiet Mitra waits on Varuṇa, the Other, awful, with the Maruis seeks renown. That Varuṇa's high worth may shine preeminent, these Twain have measured each his proper power and might.The One subdueth the destructive enemy; the Other with a few furthereth many a man. No trouble, no misfortune, Indra-Varuṇa, no woe from any side assails the mortal manWhose sacrifice, O Gods, ye visit and enjoy: ne’er doth the crafty guile of mortal injure him. With your divine protection, Heroes, come to us: mine invncation hear, if ye be pleased therewith.Bestow ye upon us, O Indra-Varuṇa, your friendship and your kinship and your favouring grace. In battle after battle, Indra-Varuṇa, be ye our Champions, ye who are the peoples' strength,When both opposing bands invoke you for the fight, and men that they may gain offspring and progeny. May Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman vouchsafe us glory and great shelter spreading far.We think of the beneficent light of Aditi, and Savitar's song of praise, the God who strengthens Law.
