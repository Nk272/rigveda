==================================================

. LET Brahmans and Aṅgirases come forward, and let the roar of cloudy heaven surround us.Loud low the Milch-kine swimming in the waters: set be the stones that grace our holy service. Fair, Agni, is thy long-known path to travel: yoke for the juice tfiy bay, thy ruddy horses,Or red steeds, Hero-bearing, for the chamber. Seated, I call the Deities' generations. They glorify your sacrifice with worship, yet the glad Priest near them is left unequalled.Bring the Gods hither, thou of many aspects: turn hitherward Aramati the Holy. What time the Guest hath made himself apparent, at ease reclining in the rich man's dwelling,Agni, well-pleased, well-placed within the chamber gives to a house like this wealth worth the choosing. Accept this sacrifice of ours, O Agni; glorify it with Indra and the Maruts.Here on our grass let Night and Dawn be seated: bring longing Varuṇa and Mitra hither. Thus hath Vasiṣṭha praised victorious Agni, yearning for wealth that giveth all subsistence.May he bestow on us food, strength, and riches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
