==================================================

. MAY we be free from every bond, Ādityas! a castle among Gods and men, ye Vasus.Winning, may we win Varuṇa and Mitra, and, being, may we be, O Earth and Heaven. May Varuṇa and Mitra grant this blessing, our Guardians, shelter to our seed and offspring.Let us not suffer for another's trespass. nor do the thing that ye, O Vasus, punish. The ever-prompt Aṅgirases, imploring riches from Savitar the God, obtained them.So may our Father who is great and holy, and all the Gods, accordant, grant this favour.
