==================================================

. AGNI, erect, hath shown enriching favour: the flame goes forward to the Gods’ assembly.Like car-borne men the stones their path have chosen: let the priest, quickened, celebrate our worship. Soft to the tread, their sacred grass is scattered: these go like Kings amid the band around them,At the folks early call on Night and Morning,—Vāyu, and Pūṣan with his team, to bless us. Here on their path the noble Gods proceeded: in the wide firmament the Beauteous decked them.Bend your way hither, ye who travel widely: hear this our envoy who hath gone to meet you. For they are holy aids at sacrifices: all Gods approach the place of congregation.Bring these, desirous, to our worship, Agni, swift the Nisatyas, Bhaga, and Purandhi. Agni, to these men's hymns, from earth, from heaven, bring Mitra, Varuṇa, Indra, and Agni,And Aryaman, and Aditi, and Viṣṇu. Sarasvatī be joyful, and the Maruts. Even as the holy wish, the gift is offered: may he, unsated, come when men desire him.Give never-failing ever-conquering riches: with Gods for our allies may we be victors. Now have both worlds been praised by the Vasisthas; and holy Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni.May they, bright Deities, make our song supremest. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
