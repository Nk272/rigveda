==================================================

. To Rudra bring these songs, whose bow is firm and strong, the self-dependent God with swiftly-flying shafts,The Wise, the Conqueror whom none may overcome, armed with sharp-pointed weapons: may he hear our call. He through his lordship thinks on beings of the earth, on heavenly beings through his high imperial sway.Come willingly to our doors that gladly welcome thee, and heal all sickness, Rudra., in our families. May thy bright arrow which, shot down by thee from heaven, flieth upon the earth, pass us uninjured by.Thou, very gracious God, hast thousand medicines: inflict no evil on our sons or progeny. Slay us not, nor abandon us, O Rudra let not thy noose, when thou art angry, seize us.Give us trimmed grass and fame among the living. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
