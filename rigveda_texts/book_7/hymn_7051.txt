==================================================

 THROUGH the Ādityas’ most auspicious shelter, through their most recent succour may we conquer.May they, the Mighty, giving ear, establish this sacrifice, to make us free and sinless. Let Aditi rejoice and the Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, most righteous.May they, the Guardians of the world, protect us, and, to show favour, drink this day our Soma. All Universal Deities, the Maruts, all the Ādityas, yea, and all the Ṛbhus,Indra, and Agni, and the Aśvins, lauded. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
