==================================================

. SLAYERS of enemies, Indra and Agni, accept this day our new-born pure laudation.Again, again I call you prompt to listen, best to give quickly strength to him who craves it. For ye were strong to gain, exceeding mighty, growing together, waxing in your vigour.Lords of the pasture filled with ample riches, bestow upon us strength both fresh and lasting. Yea when the strong have entered our assembly, and singers seeking with their hymns your favour,They are like steeds who come into the race-course, those men who call aloud on Indra-Agni. The singer, seeking with his hymns your favour, begs splendid riches of their first possessor.Further us with new bounties, Indra-Agni, armed with strong thunder, slayers of the foeman. When two great hosts, arrayed against each other, meet clothed with brightness, in the fierce encounterStand ye beside the godly, smite the godless; and still assist the men who press the Soma. To this our Soma-pressing, Indra-Agni, come ye prepared to show your loving-kindness,For not at any time have ye despised us. So may I draw you with all strengthenings hither. So Agni, kindled mid this adoration, invite thou Mitra, Varuṇa, and Indra.Forgive whatever sin we have committed may Aryaman and Aditi remove it. While we accelerate these our sacrifices, may we win strength from both of you, O Agni:Ne’er may the Maruts, Indra, Viṣṇu slight us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
