==================================================

. SHE hath shone brightly like a youthful woman, stirring to motion every living creature.Agni hath come to feed on mortal? fuel. She hath made light and chased away the darkness. Turned to this All, far-spreading, she hath risen and shone in brightness with white robes about her.She hath beamed forth lovely with golden colours, Mother of kine, Guide of the days she bringeth. Bearing the Gods’ own Eye, auspicious Lady, leading her Courser white and fair to look on,Distinguished by her bean-is Dawn shines apparent, come forth to all the world with wondrous treasure. Draw nigh with wealth and dawn away the foeman: prepare for us wide pasture free from danger.Drive away those who hate us, bring us riches: pour bounty, opulent Lady, on the singer. Send thy most excellent beams to shine and light us, giving us lengthened days, O Dawn, O Goddess,Granting us food, thou who hast all things precious, and bounty rich in chariots, kine, and horses. O Uṣas, nobly-born, Daughter of Heaven, whom the Vasisthas with their hymns make mighty,Bestow thou on us vast and glorious riches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
