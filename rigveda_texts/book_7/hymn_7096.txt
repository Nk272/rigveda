==================================================

. I SING a lofty song, for she is mightiest, most divine of Streams.Sarasvatī will I exalt with hymns and lauds, and, O Vasiṣṭha, Heaven and Earth. When in the fulness of their strength the Pūrus dwell, Beauteous One, on thy two grassy banks,Favour us thou who hast the Maruts for thy friends: stir up the bounty of our chiefs. So may Sarasvatī auspicious send good luck; she, rich in spoil, is never niggardly in thought,When praised in jamadagni's way and lauded as Vasiṣṭha lauds. We call upon Sarasvān, as unmarried men who long for wives,As liberal men who yearn for sons. Be thou our kind protector, O Sarasvān, with those waves of thineLaden with sweets and dropping oil. May we enjoy Sarasvān's breast, all-beautiful, that swells with streams,May we gain food and progeny.
