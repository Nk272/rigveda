==================================================

. MAY we obtain this day from you, O Waters, that wave of pure refreshment, which the piousMade erst the special beverage of Indra, bright, stainless, rich in sweets and dropping fatness. May the Floods' Offspring, he whose course is rapid, protect that wave most rich in sweets, O Waters,That shall make Indra and the Vasus joyful. This may we gain from you to-day, we pious. All-purifying, joying in their nature, to paths of Gods the Goddesses move onward.They never violate the laws of Indra. Present the oil-rich offering to the Rivers. Whom SÅ«rya with his bright beams hath attracted, and Indra dug the path for them to travel,May these Streams give us ample room and freedom. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
