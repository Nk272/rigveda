==================================================

 SING forth and laud Parjanya, son of Heaven, who sends the gift of rainMay he provide our pasturage. Parjanya is the God who forms in kine, in mares, in plants of earth,And womankind, the germ of life. Offer and pour into his mouth oblation rich in savoury juice:May he for ever give us food.
