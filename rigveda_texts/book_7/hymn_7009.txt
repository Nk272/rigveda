==================================================

. ROUSED from their bosom is the Dawns' beloved, the joyous Priest, most sapient, Purifier.He gives a signal both to Gods and mortals, to Gods oblations, riches to the pious. Most wise is he who, forcing doors of Paṇis, brought the bright Sun to us who feedeth many.The cheerful Priest, men's Friend and home-companion, through still night's darkness he is made apparent. Wise, ne.'er deceived, uncircumscribed, refulgent, our gracious guest, a Friend with good attendants,Shines forth with wondrous light before the Mornings; the young plants hath he entered, Child of Waters. Seeking our gatherings, he, your Jātavedas, hath shone adorable through human ages,Who gleams refulgent with his lovely lustre: the kine have waked to meet him when enkindled. Go on thy message to the Gods, and fail not, O Agni, with their band who pray and worship.Bring all the Gods that they may give us riches, Sarasvatī, the Maruts, Aśvins, Waters. Vasiṣṭha, when enkindling thee, O Agni, hath slain jarutha. Give us wealth in plenty.Sing praise in choral song, O Jātavedas. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.
