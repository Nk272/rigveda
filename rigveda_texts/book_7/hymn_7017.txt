==================================================

. AGNI, be kindled well with proper fuel, and let the grass be scattered wide about thee. Let the impatient Portals be thrown open bring thou the Gods impatient to come hither. Taste, Agni: serve the Gods with our oblation. Offer good sacrifices, Jātavedas! Let Jātavedas pay fair sacrifices, worship andgratify the Gods Immortal. Wise God, win for us things that are all-goodly, and let the prayers, we pray today be fruitful. Thee, even thee, the Son of Strength, O Agni, those Gods have made the bearer of oblations. To thee the God may we perform our worship: do thou, besought, grant us abundant riches.
