==================================================

. BE gathered all the audience of the synod: let us begin their praise whose course is rapid.Whate’er God Savitar this day produces, may we be where the Wealthy One distributes. This, dealt from heaven ' may both the Worlds vouchsafe us, and Varuṇa, Indra, Aryaman, and Mitra.May Goddess Aditi assign us riches, Vāyu and Bhaga make them ours for ever. Strong be the man and full of power, O Maruts, whom ye, borne on by spotted coursers, favour.Him, too, Sarasvatī and Agni further, and there is none to rob him of his riches. This Varuṇa is guide of Law, he, Mitra, and Aryaman, the Kings, our work have finished.Divine and foeless Aditi quickly listens. May these deliver us unharmed from trouble. With offerings I propitiate the branches of this swift-moving God, the bounteous Viṣṇu.Hence Rudra gained his Rudra-strength: O Aśvins, ye sought the house that hath celestial viands. Be not thou angry here, O glowing Pūṣan, for what Varūtrī and the Bounteous gave us.May the swift-moving Gods protect and bless us, and Vāta send us rain, wha wanders round us. Now have both worlds been praised by the Vasisthas, and holy Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni.May they, bright Deities, make our song supremest. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
