==================================================

. As, Indra, from great treason thou protectest, yea, from great treachery these who approach us,So, marking well, Controller of the Maruts grant us their blessings, for they are thy dearest. The various doings of all mortal people by thee are ordered, in thy wisdom, Indra.The host of Maruts goeth forth exulting to win the light-bestowing spoil of battle. That spear of thine sat firm for us, O Indra: the Maruts set their whole dread power in motion.E’en Agni shines resplendent in the brush-wood: the viands hold him as floods hold an island. Vouchsafe us now that opulence, O Indra, as guerdon won by mightiest donation.May hymns that please thee cause the breast of Vāyu to swell as with the mead's refreshing sweetness. With thee, O Indra, are most bounteous riches that further every one who lives uprightly.Now may these Maruts show us loving-kindness, Gods who of old were ever prompt to help us. Bring forth the Men who rain down boons, O Indra: exert thee in the great terrestrial region;For their broad-chested speckled deer are standing like a King's armies on the field of battle. Heard is the roar of the advancing Maruts, terrific, glittering, and swiftly moving,Who with their rush o’erthrow as ’twere a sinner the mortal who would fight with those who love him Give to the Mānas, Indra with Maruts, gifts universal, gifts of cattle foremost.Thou, God, art praised with Gods who must be lauded. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.
