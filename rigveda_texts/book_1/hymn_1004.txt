==================================================

 As a good cow to him who milks, we call the doer of fair deeds,To our assistance day by day. Come thou to our libations, drink of Soma; Soma-drinker thou!The rich One's rapture giveth kine. So may we be acquainted with thine innermost benevolence:Neglect us not, come hitherward. Go to the wise unconquered One, ask thou of Indra, skilled in song,Him who is better than thy friends. Whether the men who mock us say, Depart unto another place,Ye who serve Indra and none else; Or whether, God of wondrous deeds, all our true people call us blest,Still may we dwell in Indra's care. Unto the swift One bring the swift, man-cheering, grace of sacrifice,That to the Friend gives wings and joy. Thou, Śatakratu, drankest this and wast the Vṛtras’ slayer; thouHelpest the warrior in the fray. We strengthen, Śatakratu, thee, yea, thee the powerful in fight,That, Indra, we may win us wealth. To him the mighty stream of wealth, prompt friend of him who pours the juice,Yea, to this Indra sing your song.
