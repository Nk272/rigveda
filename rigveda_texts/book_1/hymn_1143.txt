==================================================

. To Agni I present a newer mightier hymn, I bring my words and song unto the Son of Strength,Who, Offspring of the Waters, bearing precious things sits on the earth, in season, dear Invoking Priest. Soon as he sprang to birth that Agni was shown forth to Mātariśvan in the highest firmament.When he was kindled, through his power and majesty his fiery splendour made the heavens and earth to shine. His flames that wax not old, beams fair to look upon of him whose face is lovely, shine with beauteous sheen.The rays of Agni, him whose active force is light, through the nights glimmer sleepless, ageless, like the floods. Send thou with hymns that Agni to his own abode, who rules, one Sovran Lord of wealth, like Varuṇa,Him, All-possessor, whom the Bhṛgus with their might brought to earth's central point, the centre of the world. He whom no force can stay, even as the Maruts’ roar, like to a dart sent forth, even as the bolt from heaven,Agni with sharpened jaws chews up and eats the trees, and conquers them as when the warrior smites his foes. And will not Agni find enjoyment in our praise, will not the Vasu grant our wish with gifts of wealth?Will not the Inspirer speed our prayers to gain their end? Him with the radiant glance I laud with this my song. The kindler of the flame wins Agni as a Friend, promoter of the Law, whose face is bright with oil.Inflamed and keen, refulgent in our gatherings, he lifts our hymn on high clad in his radiant hues. Keep us incessantly with guards that cease not, Agni, with guards auspicious, very mighty.With guards that never slumber, never heedless, never beguiled. O Helper, keep our children.
