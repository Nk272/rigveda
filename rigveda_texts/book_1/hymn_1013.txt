==================================================

 AGNI, well-kindled, bring the Gods for him who offers holy gifts.Worship them, Purifier, Priest. Son of Thyself, present, O Sage, our sacrifice to the Gods today.Sweet to the taste, that they may feast. Dear Narāśaṁsa, sweet of tongue, the giver of oblations, IInvoke to this our sacrifice. Agni, on thy most easy car, glorified, hither bring the Gods:Manu appointed thee as Priest. Strew, O ye wise, the sacred grass that drips with oil, in order due,Where the Immortal is beheld. Thrown open be the Doors Divine, unfailing, that assist the rite,For sacrifice this day and now. I call the lovely Night and Dawn to seat them on the holy grassAt this our solemn sacrifice. The two Invokers I invite, the wise, divine and sweet of tongue,To celebrate this our sacrifice. Iḷā, Sarasvatī, Mahī, three Goddesses who bring delight,Be seated, peaceful, on the grass. Tvaṣṭar I call, the earliest born, the wearer of all forms at will:May he be ours and ours alone. God, Sovran of the Wood, present this our oblation to the Gods,And let the giver be renowned. With Svāhā pay the sacrifice to Indra in the offerer's house:Thither I call the Deities.
