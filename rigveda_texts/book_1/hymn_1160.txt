==================================================

. THESE, Heaven and Earth, bestow prosperity on all, sustainers of the region, Holy Ones and wise,Two Bowls of noble kind: between these Goddesses the God, the fulgent Sun, travels by fixed decree. Widely-capacious Pair, mighty, that never fail, the Father and the Mother keep all creatures safe:The two world-halves, the spirited, the beautiful, because the Father hath clothed them in goodly forms. Son of these Parents, he the Priest with power to cleanse, Sage, sanctifies the worlds with his surpassing power.Thereto for his bright milk he milked through all the days the party-coloured Cow and the prolific Bull. Among the skilful Gods most skilled is he, who made the two world-halves which bring prosperity to all;Who with great wisdom measured both the regions out, and stablished them with pillars that shall neâ€™er decay. Extolled in song, O Heaven and Earth, bestow on us, ye mighty Pair, great glory and high lordly sway,Whereby we may extend ourselves ever over the folk; and send us strength that shall deserve the praise of men.
