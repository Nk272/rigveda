==================================================

 O SOMA DRINKER, ever true, utterly hopeless though we be,Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,In thousands, O most wealthy One. O Lord of Strength, whose jaws are strong, great deeds are thine, the powerful:Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,In thousands, O most wealthy One. Lull thou asleep, to wake no more, the pair who on each other lookDo thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,In thousands, O most wealthy One. Hero, let hostile spirits sleep, and every gentler genius wake:Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,In thousands, O most wealthy One. Destroy this ass, O Indra, who in tones discordant brays to thee:Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,In thousands, O most wealthy One. Far distant on the forest fall the tempest in a circling course!Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,In thousands, O most wealthy One. Slay each reviler, and destroy him who in secret injures us:Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kineIn thousands, O most wealthy One.
