==================================================

. AGNI, thy faithful servant I call upon thee with many a gift,As in the keeping of the great inciting God; Thou who neâ€™er movest thee to aid the indolent, the godless man,Him who though wealthy never brings an offering. Splendid, O Singer, is that man, mightiest of the great in heaven.Agni, may we be foremost, we thy worshippers.
