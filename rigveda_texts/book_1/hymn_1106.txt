==================================================

. CALL we for aid on Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa and Agni and the Marut host and Aditi.Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress. Come ye Ādityas for our full prosperity, in conquests of the foe, ye Gods, bring joy to us.Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress. May the most glorious Fathers aid us, and the two Goddesses, Mothers of the Gods, who strengthen Law.Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress. To mighty Narāśaṁsa, strengthening his might, to Pūṣan, ruler over men, we pray with hymns.Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress. Bṛhaspati, make us evermore an easy path: we crave what boon thou hast for men in rest and stir.Like as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress. Sunk in the pit the Ṛṣi Kutsa called, to aid, Indra the Vṛtra-slayer, Lord of power and might.Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us from all distress. May Aditi the Goddess guard us with the Gods: may the protecting God keep us with ceaseless care.This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.
