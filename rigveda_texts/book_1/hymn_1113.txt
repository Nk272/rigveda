==================================================

. This light is come, amid all lights the fairest; born is the brilliant, far-extending brightness.Night, sent away for Savitar's uprising, hath yielded up a birth-place for the Morning. The Fair, the Bright is come with her white offspring; to her the Dark One hath resigned her dwelling.Akin, immortal, following each other, changing their colours both the heavens move onward. Common, unending is the Sisters' pathway; taught by the Gods, alternately they travel.Fair-formed, of different hues and yet one-minded, Night and Dawn clash not, neither do they travel. Bright leader of glad sounds, our eyes behold her; splendid in hue she hath unclosed the portals.She, stirring up the world, hath shown us riches: Dawn hath awakened every living creature. Rich Dawn, she sets afoot the coiled-up sleeper, one for enjoyment, one for wealth or worship,Those who saw little for extended vision. All living creatures hath the Dawn awakened. One to high sway, one to exalted glory, one to pursue his gain, and one his labour:All to regard their different vocations, all moving creatures hath the Dawn awakened. We see her there, the Child of Heaven apparent, the young Maid, flushing in her shining raiment.Thou sovran Lady of all earthly treasure, flush on us here, auspicious Dawn, this morning. She first of endless morns to come hereafter, follows the path of morns that have departed.Dawn, at her rising, urges forth the living him who is dead she wakes not from his slumber. As thou, Dawn, hast caused Agni to be kindled, and with the Sun's eye hast revealed creation.And hast awakened men to offer worship, thou hast performed, for Gods, a noble service. How long a time, and they shall be together,—Dawns that have shone and Dawns to shine hereafter?She yearns for former Dawns with eager longing, and goes forth gladly shining with the others. Gone are the men who in the days before us looked on the rising of the earlier Morning.We, we the living, now behold her brightness and they come nigh who shall hereafter see her. Foe-chaser, born of Law, the Law's protectress, joy-giver, waker of all pleasant voices,Auspicious, bringing food for Gods’ enjoyment, shine on us here, most bright, O Dawn, this morning. From days eternal hath Dawn shone, the Goddess, and shows this light to-day, endowed with riches.So will she shine on days to come immortal she moves on in her own strength, undecaying. In the sky's borders hath she shone in splendour: the Goddess hath thrown off the veil of darkness.Awakening the world with purple horses, on her well-harnessed chariot Dawn approaches. Bringing all life-sustaining blessings with her, showing herself she sends forth brilliant lustre.Last of the countless mornings that have vanished, first of bright morns to come hath Dawn arisen. Arise! the breath, the life, again hath reached us: darkness hath passed away and light approacheth.She for the Sun hath left a path to travel we have arrived where men prolong existence. Singing the praises of refulgent Mornings with his hymn's web the priest, the poet rises.Shine then to-day, rich Maid, on him who lauds thee, shine down on us the gift of life and offspring. Dawns giving sons all heroes, kine and horses, shining upon the man who brings oblations,—These let the Soma-presser gain when ending his glad songs louder than the voice of Vāyu. Mother of Gods, Aditi's form of glory, ensign of sacrifice, shine forth exalted.Rise up, bestowing praise on our devotion all-bounteous, make us chief among the people. Whatever splendid wealth the Dawns bring with them to bless the man who offers praise and worship,Even that may Mitra, Varuṇa vouchsafe us, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.
