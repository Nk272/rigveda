==================================================

 FOR the Celestial Race this song of praise which gives wealth lavishlyWas made by singers with their lips. They who for Indra, with their mind, formed horses harnessed by a word,Attained by works to sacrifice. They for the two Nāsatyas wrought a light car moving every way:They formed a nectar-yielding cow. The Ṛbhus with effectual prayers, honest, with constant labour, madeTheir Sire and Mother young again. Together came your gladdening drops with Indra by the Maruts girt,With the Ādityas, with the Kings. The sacrificial ladle, wrought newly by the God Tvaṣṭar's hand—Four ladles have ye made thereof. Vouchsafe us wealth, to him who pours thrice seven libations, yea, to eachGive wealth, pleased with our eulogies. As ministering Priests they held, by pious acts they won themselves,A share in sacrifice with Gods.
