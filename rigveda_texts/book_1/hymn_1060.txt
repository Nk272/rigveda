==================================================

 As ’twere Some goodly treasure Mātariśvan brought, as a gift, the glorious Priest to Bhṛgu,Banner of sacrifice, the good Protector, child of two births, the swiftly moving envoy. Both Gods and men obey this Ruler's order, Gods who are worshipped, men who yearn and worship.As Priest he takes his seat ere break of morning, House-Lord, adorable with men, Ordainer. May our fair praise, heart-born, most recent, reach him whose tongue, e’en at his birth, is sweet as honey;Whom mortal priests, men, with their strong endeavour, supplied with dainty viands, have created. Good to mankind, the yearning Purifier hath among men been placed as Priest choice-worthy.May Agni be our Friend, Lord of the Household, protector of the riches in the dwelling. As such we Gotamas with hymns extol thee, O Agni, as the guardian Lord of riches,Decking thee like a horse, the swift prizewinner. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.
