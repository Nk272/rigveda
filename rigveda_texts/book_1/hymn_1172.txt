==================================================

. WONDERFUL let your coming be, wondrous with help, ye Bounteous Ones,Maruts, who gleam as serpents gleam. Far be from us, O Maruts, ye free givers, your impetuous shaft;Far from us be the stone ye hurl. O Bounteous Givers, touch ye not, O Maruts, Tṛṇskanda's folk;Lift ye us up that we may live.
