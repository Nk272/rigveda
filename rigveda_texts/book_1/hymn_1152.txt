==================================================

. THE robes which ye put on abound with fatness: uninterrupted courses are your counsels.All falsehood, Mitra-Varuṇa! ye conquer, and closely cleave unto the Law Eternal. This might of theirs hath no one comprehended. True is the crushing word the sage hath uttered,The fearful four-edged bolt smites down the three-edged, and those who hate the Gods first fall and perish. The Footless Maid precedeth footed creatures. Who marketh, Mitra-Varuṇa, this your doing?The Babe Unborn supporteth this world's burthen, fulfilleth Law and overcometh falsehood. We look on him the darling of the Maidens, always advancing, never falling downward,Wearing inseparable, wide-spread raiment, Mitra's and Varuṇa's delightful glory. Unbridled Courser, born but not of horses, neighing he flieth on with back uplifted.The youthful love mystery thought-surpassing, praising in Mitra-Varuṇa, its glory. May the milch-kine who favour Māmateya prosper in this world him who loves devotion.May he, well skilled in rites, be food, and calling Aditi with his lips give us assistance. Gods, Mitra-Varuṇa, with love and worship, let me make you delight in this oblation.May our prayer be victorious in battles, may we have rain from heaven to make us prosper.
