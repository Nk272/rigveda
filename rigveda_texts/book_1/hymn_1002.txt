==================================================

 BEAUTIFUL Vāyu, come, for thee these Soma drops have been prepared:Drink of them, hearken to our call. Knowing the days, with Soma juice poured forth, the singers glorifyThee, Vāyu, with their hymns of praise. Vāyu, thy penetrating stream goes forth unto the worshipper,Far-spreading for the Soma draught. These, Indra-Vāyu, have been shed; come for our offered dainties’ sake:The drops are yearning for you both. Well do ye mark libations, ye Vāyu and Indra, rich in spoil!So come ye swiftly hitherward. Vāyu and Indra, come to what the Soma-presser hath prepared:Soon, Heroes, thus I make my prayer. Mitra, of holy strength, I call, and foe-destroying Varuṇa,Who make the oil-fed rite complete. Mitra and Varuṇa, through Law, lovers and cherishers of Law,Have ye obtained your might power Our Sages, Mitra-Varuṇa, wide dominion, strong by birth,Vouchsafe us strength that worketh well.
