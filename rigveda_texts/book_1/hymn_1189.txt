==================================================

. BY goodly paths lead us to riches, Agni, God who knowest every sacred duty.Remove the sin that makes us stray and wander. most ample adoration will we bring thee. Lead us anew to happiness, O Agni; lead us beyond all danger and affliction.Be unto us a wide broad ample castle bless, prosper on their way our sons and offspring. Far from us, Agni, put thou all diseases let them strike lauds that have no saving Agni.God, make our home again to be a blessing, with all the Immortal Deities, O Holy. Preserve us, Agni, with perpetual succour, refulgent in the dwelling which thou lovest.O Conqueror, most youthful, let no danger touch him who praises thee to-day or after. Give not us up a prey to sin, O Agni, the greedy enemy that brings us trouble;Not to the fanged that bites, not to the toothless: give not us up, thou Conqueror, to the spoiler. Such as thou art, born after Law, O Agni when lauded give protection to our bodies,From whosoever would reproach or injure: for thou, God, rescuest from all oppression. Thou, well discerning both these classes, comest to men at early morn, O holy Agni.Be thou obedient unto man at evening, to be adorned, as keen, by eager suitors. To him have we addressed our pious speeches, I, MƒÅna's son, to him victorious Agni.May we gain countless riches with the sages. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.
