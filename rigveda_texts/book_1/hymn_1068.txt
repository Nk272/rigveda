==================================================

. COMMINGLING, restless, he ascends the sky, unveiling nights and all that stands or moves,As he the sole God is preeminent in greatness among all these other Gods. All men are joyful in thy power, O God, that living from the dry wood thou art born.All truly share thy Godhead while they keep, in their accustomed ways, eternal Law. Strong is the thought of Law, the Law's behest; all works have they performed; he quickens all.Whoso will bring oblation, gifts to thee, to him, bethinking thee, vouchsafe thou wealth. Seated as Priest with Manu's progeny, of all these treasures he alone is Lord.Men yearn for children to prolong their line, and are not disappointed in their hope. Eagerly they who hear his word fulfil his wish as sons obey their sire's behest.He, rich in food, unbars his wealth like doors: he, the House-Friend, hath decked heaven's vault with stars.
