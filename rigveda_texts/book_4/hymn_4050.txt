==================================================

. Him who with might hath propped earth's ends, who sitteth in threefold seat, Bṛhaspati, with thunder,Him of the pleasant tongue have ancient sages, deep-thinking, holy singers, set before them. Wild in their course, in well-marked wise rejoicing were they, Bṛhaspati, who pressed around us.Preserve Bṛhaspati, the stall uninjured, this company's raining, ever-moving birthplace. Bṛhaspati, from thy remotest distance have they sat down who love the law eternal.For thee were dug wells springing from the mountain, which murmuring round about pour streams of sweetness. Bṛhaspati, when first he had his being from mighty splendour in supremest heaven,Strong, with his sevenfold mouth, with noise of thunder, with his seven rays, blew and dispersed the darkness. With the loud-shouting band who sang his praises, with thunder, he destroyed obstructive Vala.Bṛhaspati thundering drave forth the cattle, the lowing cows who make oblations ready. Serve we with sacrifices, gifts, and homage even thus the Steer of all the Gods, the Father.Bṛhaspati, may we be lords of riches, with noble progeny and store of heroes. Surely that King by power and might heroic hath made him lord of all his foes' posses-ions,Who cherishes Bṛhaspati well-tended, adorns and worships him as foremost sharer. In his own house he dwells in peace and comfort: to him for ever holy food flows richly.To him the people with free will pay homage-the King with whom the Brahman hath precedence. He, unopposed, is master of the riches of his own subjects and of hostile people.The Gods uphold that King with their protection who helps the Brahman when he seeks his favour. Indra, Bṛhaspati, rainers of treasure, rejoicing at this sacrifice drink the Soma.Let the abundant drops sink deep within you: vouchsafe us riches with full store of heroes. Bṛhaspati and Indra, make us prosper may this be your benevolence to us-ward.Assist our holy thoughts, wake up our spirit: weaken the hatred of our foe and rivals.
