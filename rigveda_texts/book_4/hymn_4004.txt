==================================================

. PUT forth like a wide-spreading net thy vigour; go like a mighty King with his attendants.Thou, following thy swift net, shootest arrows: transfix the fiends with darts that burn most fiercely. Forth go in rapid flight thy whirling weapons: follow them closely, glowing in thy fury.Spread with thy tongue the winged flames, O Agni; unfettered, cast thy firebrands all around thee. Send thy spies forward, fleetest in thy motion; be, ne’er deceived, the guardian of this peopleFrom him who, near or far, is bent on evil, and let no trouble sent from thee o’ercome us. Rise up, O Agni, spread thee out before us: burn down our foes, thou who hast sharpened arrows.Him, blazing Agni! who hath worked us mischief, consume thou utterly like dried-up stubble. Rise, Agni, drive off those who fight against us: make manifest thine own celestial vigour.Slacken the strong bows of the demon-driven: destroy our foemen whether kin or stranger. Most Youthful God, he knoweth well thy favour who gave an impulse to this high devotion.All fair days and magnificence of riches hast thou beamed forth upon the good man's portals. Blest, Agni, be the man, the liberal giver, who with his lauds and regular oblationIs fain to please thee for his life and dwelling. May all his days be bright: be this his longing. I praise thy gracious favour: sing in answer. May this my song sing like a loved one with thee.Lords of good steeds and cars may we adorn thee, and day by day vouchsafe thou us dominion. Here of free choice let each one serve thee richly, resplendent day by day at eve and morning.So may we honour thee, content and joyous, passing beyond the glories of the people. Whoso with good steeds and fine gold, O Agni, comes nigh thee on a car laden with treasure,His Friend art thou, yea, thou art his Protector whose joy it is to entertain thee duly. Through words and kinship I destroy the mighty: this power I have from Gotama my father.Mark thou this speech of ours, O thou Most Youthful, Friend of the House, exceeding wise, Invoker. Knowing no slumber, speedy and propitious, alert and ever friendly, most unwearied,May thy protecting powers, unerring Agni, taking their places here, combined, preserve us. Thy guardian rays, O Agni, when they saw him, preserved blind Māmateya from affliction.Lord of all riches, he preserved the pious: the fees who fain would harm them did no mischief Aided by thee with thee may we be wealthy, may we gain strength with thee to guide us onward.Fulfil the words of both, O Ever Truthful: straightway do this, thou God whom power emboldens. O Agni, with this fuel will we serve thee; accept the laud we sing to thee with favourDestroy the cursing Rākṣasas: preserve us, O rich in friends, from guile and scorn and slander.
