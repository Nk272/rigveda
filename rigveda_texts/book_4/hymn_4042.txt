==================================================

. I AM the royal Ruler, mine is empire, as mine who sway all life are all Immortals.Varuṇa's will the Gods obey and follow. I am the King of men's most lofty cover. I am King Varuṇa. To me were given these first existing high celestial powers.Varuṇa's will the Gods obey and follow. I am the King of men's most lofty cover. I Varuṇa am Indra: in their greatness, these the two wide deep fairly-fashioned regions,These the two world-halves have I, even as Tvaṣṭar knowing all beings, joined and held together. I made to flow the moisture-shedding waters, and set the heaven firm in the scat of Order.By Law the Son of Aditi, Law Observer, hath spread abroad the world in threefold measure. Heroes with noble horses, fain for battle, selected warriors, call on me in combat.I Indra Maghavan, excite the conflict; I stir the dust, Lord of surpassing vigour. All this I did. The Gods’ own conquering power never impedeth me whom none opposeth.When lauds and Soma juice have made me joyful, both the unbounded regions are affrighted. All beings know these deeds of thine thou tellest this unto Varuṇa, thou great Disposer!Thou art renowned as having slain the Vṛtras. Thou madest flow the floods that were obstructed. Our fathers then were these, the Seven his, what time the son of Durgaha was captive.For her they gained by sacrifice Trasadasyu, a demi-god, like Indra, conquering foemen. The spouse of Purukutsa gave oblations to you, O Indra-Varuṇa, with homage.Then unto her ye gave King Trasadasyu, the demi-god, the slayer of the foeman. May we, possessing much, delight in riches, Gods in oblations and the kine in pasture;And that Milch-cow who shrinks not from the milking, O Indra-Varuṇa, give to us daily.
