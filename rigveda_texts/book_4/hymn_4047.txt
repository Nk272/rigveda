==================================================

. Vāyu, the bright is offered thee, best of the meath at holy rites.Come thou to drink the Soma juice, God, longed-for, on thy team-drawn car. O Vāyu, thou and Indra are meet drinkers of these Soma-draughts,For unto you the drops proceed as waters gather to the vale. O Indra-Vāyu, mighty Twain, speeding together, Lords of Strength,Come to our succour with your team, that ye may drink the Soma juice. The longed-for teams which ye possess, O Heroes, for the worshipper,Turn to us, Indra-Vāyu, ye to whom the sacrifice is paid.
