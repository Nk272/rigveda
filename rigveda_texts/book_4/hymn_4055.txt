==================================================

. WHO of you, Vasus, saveth? who protecteth? O Heaven and Earth and Aditi, preserve us,Varuṇa., Mitra, from the stronger mortal. Gods, which of you at sacrifice giveth comfort? They who with laud extol the ancient statutes, when they shine forth infallible dividers,Have ordered as perpetual Ordainers, and beamed as holy-thoughted Wonder-Workers. The Housewife Goddess, Aditi, and Sindhu, the Goddess Svasti I implore for friendship:And may the unobstructed Night and Morning both, day and night, provide for our protection. Aryaman, Varuṇa have disclosed the pathway, Agni as Lord of Strength the road to welfare.Lauded in manly mode may Indra-Viṣṇu grant us their powerful defence and shelter. I have besought the favour of the Maruts, of Parvata, of Bhaga God who rescues.From trouble caused by man the Lord preserve us; from woe sent by his friend let Mitra save us. Agree, through these our watery oblations, Goddesses, Heaven and Earth, with Ahibudhnya.As if to win the sea, the Gharma-heaters have opened, as they come anear, the rivers. May Goddess Aditi with Gods defend us, save us the saviour God with care unceasing.We dare not stint the sacred food of Mitra and Varuṇa upon the back of Agni. Agni is Sovran Lord of wealth, Agni of great prosperity:May he bestow these gifts on us. Hither to us, rich pleasant Dawn, bring many things to be desired,Thou who hast ample store of wealth. So then may Bhaga, Savitar, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Indra, with bounty come to us.
