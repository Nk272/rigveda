==================================================

. TASTE offerings never tasted yet, as bards enjoy the foeman's wealth.O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice. Removing curses, drawn by teams, with Indra, seated by thy side,O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice. The two dark treasuries of wealth that wearall beauties wait on thee.O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice. May nine-and-ninety harnessed steeds who yoke them at thy will bring thee.O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice. Harness, O Vāyu, to thy car a hundred well-fed tawny steeds,Yea, or a thousand steeds, and let thy chariot come to us with might.
