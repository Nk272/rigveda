==================================================

. I CALL your chariot to receive united praise mid princely men,Strong Gods who pour down wealth, of never vanquished might! Ye to Varosusaman come, Nāsatyas, for this glorious rite.With your protecting aid. Strong Gods, who pour down wealth. So with oblations we invoke you, rich in ample wealth, to-day,When night hath passed, O ye who send us plenteous food.O Aśvins, Heroes, let your car, famed, best to travel, come to us,And, for his glory, mark your zealous servant's lauds. Aśvins, who send us precious gifts, even when offended, think of him:For ye, O Rudras, lead us safe beyond our foes. For, Wonder-Workers, with fleet steeds ye fly completely round this All,Stirring our thoughts, ye Lords of splendour, honey-hued. With all-sustaining opulence, Aśvins, come hitherward to us,Ye rich and noble Heroes, ne’er to be o’erthrown. To welcome this mine offering, O ye Indra-like Nāsatyas, comeAs Gods of best accord this day with other Gods. For we, like Vyaśva, lifting up our voice like oxen, call on you:With all your loving kindness, Sages, come to us. O Ṛṣi, laud the Aśvins well. Will they not listen to thy call?Will they not burn the Paṇis who are nearer them? O Heroes, listen to the son of Vyaśva, and regard me here,Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, of one accord. Gods whom we yearn for, of your gifts, of what ye bring to us, bestowBy princes' hands on me, ye Mighty, day by day. Him whom your sacrifices clothe, even as a woman with her robe,The Aśvins help to glory honouring him well. Whoso regards your care of men as succour widest in its reach,About his dwelling go, ye Aśvins, loving us. Come to us ye who pour down wealth, come to the home which men must guard:Like shafts, ye are made meet for sacrifice by song. Most fetching of all calls, the laud, as envoy, Heroes, called to youBe it your own, O Aśvin Pair. Be ye in yonder sea of heaven, or joying in the home of food,Listen to me, Immortal Ones. This river with his lucid flow attracts you, more than all the streams,—Even Sindhu with his path of gold. O Aśvins, with that glorious fame come hither, through our brilliant song,Come ye whose ways are marked with light. Harness the steeds who draw the car, O Vasu, bring the well-fed pair.O Vāyu, drink thou of our meath: come unto our drink-offerings. Wonderful Vāyu, Lord of Right, thou who art Tvaṣṭar's son-in-law,Thy saving succour we elect. To Tvaṣṭar's son-in-law we pray for wealth whereof he hath control:For glory we seek vayu, men with juice effused. From heaven, auspicious Vāyu, come drive hither with thy noble steeds:Come on thy mighty car with wide-extending seat. We call thee to the homes of men, thee wealthiest in noble food,And liberal as a press-stone with a horse's back. So, glad and joyful in thine heart, do thou, God, Vāyu, first of allVouchsafe us water, strength, and thought.
