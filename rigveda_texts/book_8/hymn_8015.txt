==================================================

. SING forth to him whom many men invoke, to him whom many laud.Invite the powerful Indra with your songs of praise. Whose lofty might-for doubly strong is he-supports the heavens and earth,And hills and plains and floods and light with manly power. Such, Praised by many! thou art King alone thou smitest Vṛtras dead,To gain, O Indra, spoils of war and high renown. We sing this strong and wild delight of thine which conquers in the fray,Which, Caster of the Stone! gives room and shines like gold. Wherewith thou also foundest lights for Āyu and for Manu's sake:Now joying in this sacred grass thou beamest forth. This day too singers of the hymn praise, as of old, this might of thine:Win thou the waters day by day, thralls of the strong. That lofty Indra-power of thine, thy strength and thine intelligence,Thy thunderbolt for which we long, the wish makes keen. O Indra, Heaven and Earth augment thy manly power and thy renown;The waters and thy mountains stir and urge thee on. Viṣṇu the lofty ruling Power, Varuṇa, Mitra sing thy praise:In thee the Marut' company have great delight. O Indra, thou wast born the Lord of men, most liberal of thy gifts:Excellent deeds for evermore are all thine own. Ever, alone, O highly-praised, thou sendest Vṛtras to their rest:None else than Indra executes the mighty deed. Though here and there, in varied hymns, Indra, men call on thee for aid,Still with our heroes fight and win the light of heaven. Already have all forms of him entered our spacious dwelling-place:For victory stir thou Indra, up, the Lord of Might.
