==================================================

. ENDOWED, O Gods, with your primeval wisdom, come quickly with your chariot, O ye Holy.Come with your mighty powers, O ye Nāsatyas; come hither, drink ye this the third libation. The truthful Deities, the Three-and-Thirty, saw you approach before the Ever-Truthful.Accepting this our worship and libation, O Aśvins bright with fire, drink ye the Soma. Aśvins, that work of yours deserves our wonder,—the Bull of heaven and earth and air's mid region;Yea, and your thousand promises in battle, -to all of these come near and drink beside us. Here is your portion laid for you, ye Holy: come to these songs of ours, O ye Nāsatyas.Drink among us the Soma full of sweetness, and with your powers assist the man who worships.
