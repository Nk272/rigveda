==================================================

. WITH powers of Mighty Ones hath he, Ancient, Beloved, been equipped,Through whom the Father Manu made prayers efficacious with the Gods. Him, Maker of the sky, let stones wet with the Soma ne’er forsake,Nor hymns and prayer that must be said. Indra who knew full well disclosed the kine to the Aṅgirases.This his great deed must be extolled. Indra, promoter of the song, the sage's Strengthener as of old,Shall come to bless and succour us at presentation of this laud. Now after their desire's intent the pious singers with the cryOf Hail! have sung loud hymns to thee, Indra, to gain a stall of kine. With Indra rest all deeds of might, deeds done and yet to be performed,Whom singers know devoid of guile. When the Five Tribes with all their men to Indra have sent out their voice,And when the priest hath strewn much grass, this is the Friend's own dwelling-place. This praise is verily thine own: thou hast performed these manly deeds,And sped the wheel upon its way. At the o’erflowing of this Steer, boldly he strode for life, and tookSoma as cattle take their corn. Receiving this and craving help, we, who with you are Dakṣa's sons,Would fain exalt the Maruts’ Lord. Yea, Hero, with the singers we sing to the duly-coming Band.Allied with thee may we prevail. With us are raining Rudras, clouds accordant in call to battle, at the death of Vṛtra,
