==================================================

. THE Cow, the famous Mother of the wealthy Maruts, pours her milk:Both horses of the cars are yoked,— She in whose bosom all the Gods, and Sun and Moon for men to see,Maintain their everlasting Laws. This all the pious sing to us, and sacred poets evermore:The Maruts to the Soma-draught Here is the Soma ready pressed of this the Maruts drink, of thisSelf-luminous the Aśvins drink. Of this, moreover, purified, set in three places, procreant,Drink Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman. And Indra, like the Herald Priest, desirous of the milky juice,At early morn will quaff thereof. When have the Princes gleamed and shone through waters as through troops of foes'?When hasten they whose might ispure? What favour do I claim this day of yougreat Deities, you who areWondrously splendid in yourselves? call, to drink the Soma, those Maruts who spread all realms of earthAnd luminous regions of the sky. You, even such, pure in your might, you, O ye Maruts, I invokeFrom heaven to drink this Somajuice. The Maruts, those who have sustained and propped the heavens and earth apart,I call to drink this Soma juice. That vigorous band of Maruts that abidetb in the mountains, IInvoke to drink this Soma juice.
