==================================================

. GREAT, verily, is Indra's might. I have beheld, and hither comesThy bounty, Dasyave-vrka! A hundred oxen white of hue are shining like the stars in heaven,So tall, they seem to prop the sky. Bamboos a hundred, a hundred dogs, a hundred skins of beasts well-tanned,A hundred tufts of Balbaja, four hundred red-hued mares are mine. Blest by the Gods, Kinvayanas! be ye who spread through life on life:Like horses have ye stridden forth. Then men extolled the team of seven not yet full-grown, its fame is great.The dark mares rushed along the paths, so that no eye could follow them.
