==================================================

. O THUNDERER, zealous worshippers gave thee drink this time yesterday.So, Indra, listen here to those who bring the laud: come near unto our dwellingplace. Lord of Bay Steeds, fair-helmed, rejoice thee: this we crave. Here the disposers wait on thee.Thy loftiest glories claim our lauds beside the juice, O Indra, Lover of the Song. Turning, as ’twere, to meet the Sun, enjoy from Indra all good things.When he who will be born is born with power we look to treasures as our heritage. Praise him who sends us wealth, whose bounties injure none: good are the gifts which Indra. grants.He is not worth with one who satisfies his wish: he turns his mind to giving boons. Thou in thy battles, Indra, art subduer of all hostile bands.Father art thou, aIl-conquering, cancelling the curse, thou victor of the vanquisher. The Earth and Heaven clung close to thy victorious might as to their calf two mother-cows.When thou attackest Vṛtra all the hostile bands shrink and faint, Indra, at thy wrath. Bring to your aid the Eternal One, who shoots and none may shoot at him,Inciter, swift, victorious, best of Charioteers. Tugrya's unvanquished Strengthener; Arranger of things unarranged, e’en Śatakratu, source of might,Indra, the Friend of all, for succour we invoke, Guardian of treasure, sendjng wealth.
