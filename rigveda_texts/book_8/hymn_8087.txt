==================================================

. To Indra sing a Sāma hymn, a lofty song to Lofty Sage,To him who guards the Law, inspired, and fain for praise. Thou, Indra, art the Conqueror: thou gavest splendour to the Sun.Maker of all things, thou art Mighty and All-God. Radiant with light thou wentest to the sky, the luminous realm of heaven.ne Deities, Indra strove to win thee for their Friend. Come unto us, O Indra, dear, still conquering, unconcealable,Vast as a mountain spread on all sides, Lord of Heaven. O truthful Soma-drinker, thou art mightier than both the worlds.Thou strengthenest him who pours libation, Lord of Heaven. For thou art he, O Indra, wiio stormeth all castles of the foe,Slayer of Dasyus, man's Supporter, Lord of Heaven. Now have we, Indra, Friend of Song, sent our great wishes forth to thee,Coming like floods that follow floods. As rivers swell the ocean, so, Hero, our prayers increase thy might,Though of thyself, O Thunderer, waxing day by day. With holy song mey bind to the broad wide-yoked car the Bay Steeds of the rapid God,Bearers of Indra, yoked by word. O Indra, bring great strength to us, bring valour, Śatakratu, thou most active, bringA hero conquering in war. For, gracious Śatakratu, thou hast ever been a Mother and a Sire to us,So now for bliss we pray to thee. To thee, Strong, Much-invoked, who showest forth thy strength, O Śatakratu, do I speak:So grant thou us heroic strength.
