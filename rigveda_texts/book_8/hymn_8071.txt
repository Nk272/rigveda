==================================================

. HASTE forward to us from afar, or, Vá¹›tra-slayer, from anear,To meet the offering to the meath. Strong are the Soma-draughts; come nigh: the juices fill thee with delight:Drink boldly even as thou art wont'. Joy, Indra, in the strengthening food et it content thy wish and thought,And be delightful to thine heart. Come to us thou who hast no foe: we call thee down to hymns of praise,In heaven's sublimest realm of light. This Soma here expressed with stones and dressed with milk for thy carouse,Indra, is offered up to thee. Graciously, Indra, hear my call. Come and obtain the draught, and sateThyself with juices blent with milk. The Soma, Indra, which is shed in chalices and vats for thee,Drink thou, for thou art Lord thereof. The Soma seen within the vats, as in the flood the Moon is seen,Drink thou, for thou art Lord thereof. That which the Hawk brought in his claw, inviolate, through the air to thee,Drink thou, for thou art Lord thereof.
