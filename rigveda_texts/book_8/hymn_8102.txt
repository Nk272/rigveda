==================================================

. HE whom the priests in sundry ways arranging the sacrifice, of one accord, bring hither,Who was appointed as a learned Brahman, -what is the sacrificer's knowledge of him? Kindled in many a spot, still One is Agni; Silrya is One though high o’er all he shineth.Illumining this All, still One is usas. That which is One hath into All developed. The chariot bright and radiant, treasure-laden, three-wheeled, with easy seat, and lightly rolling,Which She of Wondrous Wealth was born to harness,—this car of yours I call. Drink what remaineth.
