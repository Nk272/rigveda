==================================================

. THE Thirty Gods and Three besides, whose seat hath been the sacred grass,From time of old have found and gained. Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Agnis, with Consorts, sending boons,To whom our Vaṣaṭ! is addressed: These are our guardians in the west, and northward here, and in the south,And on the cast, with all the tribe. Even as the Gods desire so verily shall it be. None minisheth this power of theirs,No demon, and no mortal The Seven carry seven spears; seven are the splendours they possess,And seven the glories they assume.
