==================================================

. WE choose unto ourselves that high protection of the Mighty GodsThat it may help and succour us. May they be ever our allies, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,Far-seeing Gods who prosper us. Ye furtherers of holy Law, transport us safe o’er many woes,As over water-floods in ships. Dear wealth be Aryaman to us, Varuṇa dear wealth meet for praise:Dear wealth we choose unto ourselves. For Sovrans of dear wealth are ye, Ādityas, not of sinner's wealth,Ye sapient Gods who slay the foe. We in our homes, ye Bounteous Ones, and while we journey on the road,Invoke you, Gods, to prosper us. Regard us, Indra, Viṣṇu, here, ye Aśvins and the Marut host,Us who are kith and kin to you. Ye Bounteous Ones, from time of old we here set forth our brotherhood,Our kinship in. the Mother's womb. Then come with Indra for your chief, as early day, ye Bounteous GodsYea,  address you now for this.
