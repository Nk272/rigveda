==================================================

. AGNI the Herald, like a horse, is led forth at our solemn rite,God among Gods adorable. Three times unto our solemn rite comes Agni like a charioteer,Bearing the viands to the Gods. Round the oblations hath he paced, Agni the Wise, the Lord of Strength,Giving the offerer precious boons. He who is kindled eastward for Sṛñjaya, Devāvata's son,Resplendent, tamer of the foe. So mighty be the Agni whom the mortal hero shall command,With sharpened teeth and bountiful. Day after day they dress him, as they clean a horse who wins the prize.Dress the red Scion of the Sky. When Sahadeva's princely son with two bay horses thought of me,Summoned by him I drew not back. And truly those two noble bays I straightway took when offered me,From Sahadeva's princely son. Long, O ye Aśvins, may he live, your care, ye Gods, the princely son.Of Sahadeva, Somaka. Cause him the youthful prince, the son of Sahadeva, to enjoyLong life, O Aśvins, O ye Gods.
