. DRINK the best draught of Soma-juice, O Vāyu, at our holy rites:For thou art he who drinketh first. Come, team-drawn, with thy hundred helps, with Indra, seated in the car,Vāyu, and drink your fill of juice. May steeds a thousand bring you both, Indra. and Vāyu, hitherwardTo drink the Soma, to the feast. For ye, O Indra-Vāyu, mount the golden-seated car that aidsThe sacrifice, that reaches heaven. On far-refulgent chariot come unto the man who offers gifts:Come, Indra-Vāyu, hitherward. Here, Indra-Vāyu, is the juice: drink it, accordant with the Gods,Within the giver's dwelling-place. Hither, O Indra-Vāyu, be your journey here unyoke your steeds,Here for your draught of Soma juice.
