==================================================

. WHOSO enkindles thee, with lifted ladle, and thrice this day offers thee food, O Agni,May he excel, triumphant through thy splendours, wise through thy mental power, O JƒÅtavedas. Whoso with toil and trouble brings thee fuel, serving the majesty of mighty Agni,He, kindling thee at evening and at morning, prospers, and comes to wealth, and slays his foemen. Agni is Master of sublime dominion, Agni is Lord of strength and lofty riches.Straightway the self-reliant God, Most Youthful, gives treasures to the mortal who adores him. Most Youthful God, whatever sin, through folly, we here, as human beings, have committed,In sight of Aditi make thou us sinless remit, entirely, Agni, our offences. Even in the presence of great sin, O Agni, free us from prison of the Gods or mortals.Never may we who are thy friends be injured: grant health and strength unto our seed and offspring. Even as ye here, Gods Excellent and Holy, have loosed the cow that by the foot was tethered,So also set us free from this affliction long let our life, O Agni, be extended.
