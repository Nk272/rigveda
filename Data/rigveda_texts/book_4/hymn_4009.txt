==================================================

. AGNI, show favour: great art thou who to this pious man art come,To seat thee on the sacred grass. May he the Immortal, Helper, bard to be deceived among mankind,Become the messenger of all. Around the altar is he led, welcome Chief Priest at solemn rites,Or as the Potar sits him down. Agni in fire at sacrifice, and in the house as Lord thereof,And as a Brahman takes his seat. Thou comest as the guide of folk who celebrate a sacrifice,And to oblations brought by men. Thou servest as his messenger whose sacrifice thou lovest well,To bear the mortal's gifts to heaven. Accept our solemn rite; be pleased, Aá¹…giras, with our sacrifice:Give ear and listen to our call. May thine inviolable car, wherewith thou guardest those who give,Come near to us from every side.
