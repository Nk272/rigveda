==================================================

. YOUR envoy who possesses all, Immortal, bearer of your gifts,Best worshipper, I woo with song. He, Mighty, knows the gift of wealth, he knows the deep recess of heaven:He shall bring hitherward the Gods. He knows, a God himself, to guide Gods to the righteous in his home:He gives eâ€™en treasures that we love. He is the Herald: well-informed, he doth his errand to and fro,Knowing the deep recess of heaven. May we be they who gratify Agni with sacrificial gifts,Who cherish and enkindle him. Illustrious for wealth are they, and hero deeds, victorious,Who have served Agni reverently. So unto us, day after day, may riches craved by many come,And power and might spring up for us. That holy Singer in his strength shoots forth his arrows swifter thanThe swift shafts of the tribes of men.
