==================================================

. ALLIED with thee, in this thy friendship, Soma, Indra for man made waters flow together,Slew Ahi, and sent forth the Seven Rivers, and opened as it were obstructed fountains. Indu, with thee for his confederate, Indra swiftly with might pressed down the wheel of Sūrya.What rolled, all life's support, on heaven's high summit was separated from the great oppressor. Indra smote down, Agni consumed, O Indu, the Dasyus ere the noontide in the conflict.Of those who gladly sought a hard-won dwelling he cast down many a thousand with his arrow. Lower than all besides hast thou, O Indra, cast down the Dasyus, abject tribes of Dāsas.Ye drave away, ye put to death the foemen, and took great vengeance with your murdering weapons. So, of a truth, Indra and Soma, Heroes, ye burst the stable of the kine and horses,The stable which the bar or stone obstructed; and piercing through set free the habitations.
