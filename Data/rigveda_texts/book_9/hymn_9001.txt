==================================================

. In sweetest and most gladdening streamflow pure, O Soma, on thy way,Pressed out for Indra, for his drink. Fiend-queller, Friend of all men, he hath with the wood attained untoHis place, his iron-fashioned home. Be thou best Vṛtra-slayer, best granter of bliss, most liberal:Promote our wealthy princes' gifts. Flow onward with thy juice unto the banquet of the Mighty Gods:Flow hither for our strength and fame. O Indu, we draw nigh to thee, with this one object day by day:To thee alone our prayers are said By means of this eternal fleece may Sūrya's Daughter purifyThy Soma that is foaming forth. Ten sister maids of slender form seize him within the press and holdHim firmly on the final day. The virgins send him forth: they blow the the skin musician-like and fuseThe triple foe-repelling meath. Inviolable milch-kine round about him blend for Indra's drink,The fresh young Soma with their milk. In the wild raptures of this draught, Indra slays all the Vṛtras: he,The Hero, pours his wealth on us.
