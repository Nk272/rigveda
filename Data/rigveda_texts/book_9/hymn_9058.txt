==================================================

. SWIFT runs this giver of delight, even the stream of flowing juice:Swift runs this giver of delight. The Morning knows all precious things, the Goddess knows her grace to man:Swift runs this giver of delight. We have accepted thousands from Dhvasra's and Puruá¹£anti's hands:Swift runs this giver of delight. From whom we have accepted thus thousands and three times ten beside:Swift runs this giver of delight.
