==================================================

. LIKE able coursers they have been sent forth to be the feast of Gods,joying in mountains, flowing on. To VƒÅyu flow the Soma-streams, the drops of juice made beautifulLike a bride dowered by her sire. Pressed in the mortar, these, the drops ofjuice, the Somas rich in food,Give strength to Indra with their work. Deft-handed men, run hither, seize the brilliant juices blent with meal,And cook with milk the gladdening draught. Thus, Soma, Conqueror of wealth! flow, finding furtherance for us,Giver oF ample opulence. This Pavamana, meet to be adorned, the fingers ten adorn,The draught that shall make Indra glad.
