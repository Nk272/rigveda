==================================================

. WE will enrobe with sacred song the Lovely One who, as a Steed,Is decked with milk for rapturous joy. All songs of ours desiring grace adorn him in the ancient way,Indu for Indra, for his drink. Soma flows on when purified, beloved and adorned with songs,Songs of the sage MedhyƒÅtithi. O Soma Pavamana, find exceeding glorious wealth for us,Wealth, Indu, fraught with boundless might. Like courser racing to the prize Indu, the lover of the Gods,Roars, as he passes, in the sieve. Flow on thy way to win us strength, to speed the sage who praises thee:Soma, bestow heroic power.
