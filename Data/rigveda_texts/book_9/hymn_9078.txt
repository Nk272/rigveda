==================================================

. RAISING his voice the King hath flowed upon his way: invested with the waters he would win the kine.The fleece retains his solid parts as though impure, and bright and cleansed he seeks the special place of Gods. Thou, Soma, art effused for Indra by the men, balmed in the wood as wave, Sage, Viewer of mankind.Full many are the paths whereon thou mayest go: a thousand bay steeds hast thou resting in the bowls. Apsarases who dwell in waters of the sea, sitting within, have flowed to Soma wise of heart.They urge the Master of the house upon his way, and to the Eternal Pavamana pray for bliss. Soma flows on for u's as winner of the kine, winner of thousands, cars, water, and light, and gold;He whom the Gods have made a gladdening draught to drink, the drop most sweet to taste, weal-bringing, red of hue. Soma, as Pavamana thou, our faithful Friend, making for us these real treasures, flowest on.Slay thou the enemy both near and,far away: grant us security and ample pasturage.
