==================================================

. FLOW On, O thou of lofty thought, flow swift in thy beloved form,Saying, I go where dwell the Gods. Preparing what is unprepared, and bringing store of food to man,Make thou the rain descend from heaven. With might, bestowing power, thejuice enters the purifying sieve,Far-seeing, sending forth its light. This is it which in rapid course hath with the river's wave flowed downFrom heaven upon the straining cloth. Inviting him frorh far away, and even from near at hand, the juiceFor Indra is poured forth as meath. In union they have sung the hymn: with stones they urge the Tawny One.Sit in the place of sacrifice.
