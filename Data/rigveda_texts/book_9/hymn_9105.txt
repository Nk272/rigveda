==================================================

. SING; ye aloud, O friends, to him who makes him pure for gladdening drink:They shall make sweet the Child with sacrifice and laud. Like as a calf with mother cows, so Indu is urged forth and sent,Glorified by our hymns, the God-delighting juice. Effectual means of power is he, he is a banquet for the Troop,He who hath been effused, most rich in meath, for Gods. Flow to us, Indu, passing, strong, effused, with wealth of kine and steeds:I will spread forth above the milk thy radiant hue. Lord of the tawny, Indu thou who art the God's most special food,As Friend to friend, for splendour be thou good to men. Drive utterly, far away from us each godless, each voracious foe.O Indu, overcome and drive the false afar.
