==================================================

. THY streams that never fail or waste flow forth like showers of rain from heaven,To bring a thousand stores of strength. He flows beholding on his way all wellbeloved sacred lore,Green-tinted, brandishing his, arms. He, when the people deck him like a docile king of elephants.Sits as a falcon in the, wood. So bring thou hitherward to us, Indu, while thou art purified,All treasures both of heaven and earth.
