==================================================

. THE, Soma-drops, benevolent, come forth as they are purified,Bestowing wealth which all may see. O Indu, high oâ€™er heaven and earth be thou, increaser of our might:The Master of all strength be thou. The winds are gracious in their love to thee, the rivers flow to theeSoma, they multiply thy power. Soma, wax great. From every side may vigorous powers unite in thee:Be in the gathering-Place of strength. For thee, brown-hued! the kine have poured imperishable oil and milk.Aloft on the sublimest height. Friendship, O Indu, we desire with thee who bearest noble arms,With thee, O Lord of all that is.
