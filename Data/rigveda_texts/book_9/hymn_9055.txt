==================================================

. POUR on us with thy juice all kinds of corn, each sort of nourishment,And, Soma, all felicities. As thine, O Indu, is the praise, and thine what springeth from the juice,Seat thee on the dear sacred grass. And, finding for us kine and steeds, O Soma, with thy juice flow onThrough days that fly most rapidly. As one who conquers, neâ€™er subdued, attacks and stays the enemy,Thus, Vanquisher of thousands! flow.
