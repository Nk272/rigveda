==================================================

. O'ERPOWERING Vṛtras, forward run to win great strength:Thou speedest to subdue like one exacting debts. In thee, effused, O Soma, we rejoice ourselves for great supremacy in fight.Thou, Pavamana, enterest into mighty deeds, O Pavamana, thou didst generate the Sun, and spread the moisture out with power,Hasting to us with plenty vivified with milk. Thou didst produce him, Deathless God mid mortal men for maintenance of Law and lovely Amṛta:Thou evermore hast moved making strength flow to us. All round about hast thou with glory pierced for us as ’twere a never-failing well for men to drink,Borne on thy way in fragments from the presser's arms. Then, beautifully radiant, certain Heavenly Ones, have sung to him their kinship as they looked thereon,And Savitar the God opens as ’twere a stall. Soma, the men of old whose grass was trimmed addressed the hymn to thee for mighty strength and for renown:So, Hero, urge us onward to heroic power. They have drained forth from out the great depth of the sky the old primeval milk of heaven that claims the laud:They lifted up their voice to Indra athis birth. As long as thou, O Pavamana, art above this earth and heaven and all existence in thy might,Thou standest like a Bull the chief amid the herd. In the sheep's wool hath Soma Pavamana flowed, while they cleanse him, like a playful infant,Indu with hundred powers and hundred currents. Holy and sweet, while purified, this Indu flows on, a wave of pleasant taste, to Indra,—Strength-winner, Treasure-finder, Life. bestower. So flow thou on, subduing our assailants, chasing the demons hard to beencountered,Well-armed and conquering our foes, O Soma.
