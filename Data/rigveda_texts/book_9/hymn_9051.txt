==================================================

. ADHVARYU, on the filter pour the Soma juice expressed with stones,And make it pure for Indra's drink. Pour out for Indra, Thunder-armed, the milk of heaven,, the Soma's juice,Most excellent, most rich in sweets. These Gods and all the Marut host, Indu enjoy this juice of thine,This Pavamana's flowing meath. For, Soma, thou hast been effused, strengthening for the wild carouse,O Steer, the singer, for our help. Flow with thy stream, Far-sighted One, effused, into the cleansing sieve:Flow on to give us strength and fame.
