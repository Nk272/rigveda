==================================================

. Soma, thou art a splendid Steer, a Steer, O God, with steerlike sway:Thou as a Steer ordainest laws. Steer-strong thy might is as a steer's, steerstrong thywood, steer-like thy drinkA Steer indeed, O Steer, art thou. Thou, Indu, as a vigorous horse, hast neighed together steeds and kine:Unbar for us the doors to wealth. Out of desire of cows and steeds and horses. potent Soma-drops,Brilliant and swift, have been effused. They purified in both the hands, made beautiful by holy men,Flow onward to the fleecy cloth. These Soma juices shall pour forth all treasures for the worshipperFrom heaven and earth and firmament. The streams of Pavamana, thine, Finder of all, have been effused,Even as Sūrya's rays of light. Making the light that shines from heaven thou flowest on to every formSoma, thou swellest like a sea. Urged on thou sendest out thy voice, O Pavamana; thou hast moved,Like the God Sūrya, to the sieve. Indu, Enlightener, Friend, hath been purified by the sages' hymns:So starts the charioteer his steed- Thy God-delighting wave which hath flowed to purifying seive,Alighting in the home of Law. Flow to our sieve, a gladdening draught that hath most intercourse with Gods,Indu, to Indra for his drink. Flow onward with a stream for food, made beautiful by sapient men:Indu with sheen approach the milk. While thou art cleansed, Song-Lover, bring comfort and vigour to the folk,Poured, Tawny One! on milk and curds. Purified for the feast of Gods, go thou to Indra's special place,Resplendent, guided by the strong. Accelerated by the hymn, the rapid drops of Soma juiceHave flowed, urged onward, to the lake. Easily have the living drops, made beautiful, approached the lake,Yea, to the place of sacrifice. Compass about, our faithful Friend, all our possessions with thy might:Guard, hero like, our sheltering home. Loud neighs the Courser Etaśa, with singers, harnessed for the place,Guided for travel to the lake. What time the Swift One resteth in the golden place of sacrifice,He leaves the foolish far away. The friends have sung in unison, the prudent wish to sacrifice:Down sink the unintelligent. For Indra girt by Maruts, flow, thou Indu, very rich in sweets,To sit in place of sacrifice. Controlling priests and sages skilled in holy song adorn thee well:The living make thee beautiful. Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa drink Pavamana's juice, yea, thine:O Sage, the Maruts drink thereof. O Soma, Indu, thou while thou art purified urgest onward speech.Thousandfold, with the lore of hymns. Yea, Soma, Indu, while thou art purified do thou bring to usSpeech thousandfold that longs for war. O Indu, Much-invoked, while thou art purifying, as the Friend.Of these men enter thou the lake. Bright are these Somas blent with milk, with light that flashes brilliantly. And form that utters loud acclaim. Led by his drivers, and sent forth, the Strong Steed hath come nigh for spoil,Like warriors when they stand arrayed. Specially, Soma, coming as a Sage from heaven to prosper us,Flow like the Sun for us to see.
