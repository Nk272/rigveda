==================================================

. Pour forth on us abundant wealth, O Pavamana, with thy stream.Wherewith thou mayest find us light O Indu, swayer of the sea, shaker of all things, flow thou on,Bearer of wealth to us with might. With thee for Hero, Valiant One! may we subdue our enemies:Let what is precious flow to us. Indu arouses strength the Sage who strives for victory, winning power,Discovering holy works and means. Mover of speech, we robe him with our songs as he is purifiedSoma, the Guardian of the folk; On whose way, Lord of Holy Law, most richi as he is purified.The people all have set their hearts.
