==================================================

. OBEYING Indra's dear desire these Soma juices have flowed forth,Increasing his heroic might. Laid in the bowl, pure-flowing on to Vāyu and the Aśvins, mayThese give us great heroic strength. Soma, as thou art purified, incite to bounty Indra's heart,To sit in place of sacrifice. The ten swift fingers deck thee forth, seven ministers impel thee on:The sages have rejoiced in thee. When through the filter thou art poured, we clothe thee with a robe of milkTo be a gladdening draught for Gods. When purified within the jars, Soma, brightred and golden-hued,Hath clothed him with a robe of milk. Flow on to us and make us rich. Drive all our enemies away.O Indu, flow into thy Friend.Send down the rain from heaven, a stream of opulence from earth. Give us,O Soma, victory in war. May we obtain thee, Indra's drink, who viewest men and findest light,Gain thee, and progeny and food.
