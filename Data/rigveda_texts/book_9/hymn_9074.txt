==================================================

. BORN like a youngling he hath clamoured in the wood, when he, the Red, the Strong, would win the light of heaven.He comes with heavenly seed that makes the water swell: him for wide-spreading shelter we implore with prayer. A far-extended pillar that supports the sky the Soma-stalk, filled full, moves itself every way.He shall bring both these great worlds while the rite proceeds: the Sage holds these who move! together and all food. Wide space hath he who follows Aditi's right path, and mighty, well-made food, meath blent with Soma juice;He who from hence commands the rain, Steer of the kine, Leader of floods, who helps us hence, who claims our laud. Butter and milk are drawn from animated cloud; thence Amṛta is produced, centre of sacrifice.Hini the Most Bounteous Ones, ever united, love; him as ouir Friend the Men who make all swell rain down. The Soma-stalk hath roared, following with the wave: he swells with sap for man the skin which Gods enjoy.Upon the lap of Aditi he lays the germ, by means whereof we gain children and progeny. In the third region which distils a thousand streams, may the Exhaustless Ones descend with procreant power.The kindred Four have been sent downward from the heavens: dropping with oil they bring Amṛta and sacred gifts. Soma assumes white colour when he strives to gain: the bounteous Asura knows full many a precious boon.Down the steep slope, through song, he comes to sacrifice, and he will burst the water-holding cask of heaven, Yea, to the shining milk-anointed beaker, as to his goal, hath stepped the conquering Courser.Pious-souled men have sent their giffi of cattle unto Kakṣīvān of the hundred winters. Soma, thy juice when thou art blended with the streams, flows, Pavamana, through the long wool of the sheep.So, cleansed by sages. O best giver of delight, grow sweet for Indra, Pavamana! for his drink.
