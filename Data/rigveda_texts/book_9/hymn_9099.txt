==================================================

. THEY for the Bold and Lovely One ply manly vigour like a bow:joyous, in front of songs they weave bright raiment for the Lord Divine. And he, made beautiful by night, dips forward into strengthening food',What time the sacrificer's thoughts speed on his way the Golden-hued. We cleanse this gladdening drink of his the juice which Indra chiefly drinksâ€”-That which kine took into their mouths, of old, and princes take it now. To him, while purifying, they have raised the ancient psalm of praise:And sacred songs which bear the names of Gods have supplicated him. They purify him as he drops, courageous, in the fleecy sieve.Him they instruct as messenger to bear the sage's morning prayer. Soma, best Cheerer, takes his seat, the while they cleanse him in the bowls.He as it were impregns the cow, and babbles on, the Lord of Song. He is effused and beautified, a God for Gods, by skilful men.He penetrates the mighty floods collecting all he knows therein. Pressed, Indu, guided by the men, thou art led to the cleaning sieve.Thou, yielding Indra highest joy, takest thy seat within the bowls.
