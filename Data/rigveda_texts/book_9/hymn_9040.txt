==================================================

. THE Very Active hath assailed, while purified, all enemies:They deck the Sage with holy songs. The Red hath mounted to his place; to India, goes the mighty juice:He settles in his firm abode. O Indu, Soma, send us now great opulence from every side, Pour on us treasures thousandfold. O Soma Pavamana, bring, Indu, all splcndours hitherward:Find for us food in boundless store. As thou art cleansed, bring hero strength and riches to thy worshipper,And prosper thou the singer's hymns. O Indu, Soma, being cleansed, bring hither riches doublypiled,Wealth, mighty Indu, meet for lauds.
