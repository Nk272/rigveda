==================================================

. THE sages with the fingers' art have dressed and decked that vigorous SteedUpon the lap of Aditi, The kine have called aloud to him exhaustless with a thousand streams,To Indu who supporteth heaven. Him, nourisher of many, Sage, creative Pavamana, theyHave sent, by wisdom, to the sky. Him, dweller with VivasvƒÅn, they with use of both arms have sent forth,The Lord of Speech infallible. Him, green, beloved, many eyed, the Sisters with prosing stonesSend down to ridges of the sieve. O Pavamana, Indu, priests hurry thee on to Indra, theeWho aidest song and cheerest him.
