==================================================

. PLEASANT to Indra's Mitra's, Pūṣan's Bhaga's taste, sped onward, Soma, with thy flowing stream. Let Indra drink, O Soma, of thy juice for wisdom, and all Deities for strength. So flow thou on as bright celestial juice, flow to the vast, immortal dwelling-place. Flow onward, Soma, as a mighty sea, as Father of the Gods to every form. Flow on, O Soma, radiant for the Gods and Heaven and Earth and bless our progeny. Thou, bright Juice, art Sustainer of the sky: flow, mighty, in accordance with true Law. Soma, flow splendid with thy copious stream through the great fleece as in the olden time. Bom, led by men, joyous, and purified, let the Light-finder make all blessings flow: Indu, while cleansed, keeping the people safe, shall give us all possessions for our own. Flow on for wisdom, Soma, and for power, as a strong courser bathed, to win the prize. The pressers purify this juice of thine, the Soma, for delight, and lofty fame They deck the Gold-hued Infant, newlyborn, even Soma, Indu, in the sieve for Gods. Fair Indu hath flowed on for rapturous joy, Sage for good fortune in the waters' lap. He bears the beauteous name of Indra, that wherewith he overcame all demon foes. All Deities are wont to drink of him, pressed by the men and blent with milk and curds. He hath flowed forth with thousand streams effused, flowed ihsough the filter and the sheep's long wool. With endless genial flow the Strong hath run, purified by the waters, blent with milk. Pressed out with stones, directed by the men, go fortli, O Soma, into Indra's throat. The mighty Soma with a thousand streams is poured to Indra through the cleansing sieve. Indu they balm with pleasant milky juice for Indra, for the Steer, for his delight. Lightly, for sheen, they cleanse thee for the Gods, gold-coloured, wearing water as thy robe. Indu to Indra streams, yea, downward streams, Strong, flowing to the floods, and mingling -there.
