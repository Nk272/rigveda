==================================================

. FORWARD with mighty force have flowed the currents of this Steer effused,Of him who sets him by the Gods. The singers praise him with their song, and learned priests adorn the Steed,Brought forth as light that merits laud. These things thou winnest lightly while purified, Soma, Lord of wealth:Fill full the sea that claims our praise. Winning all precious things at once, flow on, O Soma, with thy streamDrive to one place our enemies. Preserve us from the godless, from ill-omened voice of one and all,That so we may be freed from blame. O Indu, as thou flowest on bring us the wealth of earth and heaven,And splendid vigour, in thy stream.
