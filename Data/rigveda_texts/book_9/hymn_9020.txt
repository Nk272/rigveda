==================================================

. FORTH through the straining-cloth the Sage flows to the banquet of the Gods,Subduing all our enemies. For he, as Pavamana, sends thousandfold treasure in the shapeOf cattle to the singing-men. Thou graspest all things with thy mind, and purifiest thee with thoughtsAs such, O Soma, find us fame. Pour lofty glory on us, send sure riches to our liberal lords,Bring food to those who sing thy praise. As thou art cleansed, O Wondrous Steed, O Soma, thou hast entered, likeA pious King, into the songs. He, Soma, like a courser in the floods invincible, made cleanWith hands, is resting in the jars. Disporting, like a liberal chief, thou goest, Soma, to the sieve,Lending the laud a Hero's strength.
