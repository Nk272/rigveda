==================================================

. To Soma who is purified as ordering Priest the song is raised:Bring meed, as ’twere, to one who makes thee glad with hymns. Blended with milk and curds he flows on through the long wool of the sheep.The Gold-hued, purified, makes him three seats for rest. On through the long wool of the sheep to the meath-dropping vat he flows:The Ṛṣis’ sevenfold quire hath sung aloud to him. Shared by all Gods, Infallible, the Leader of our holy hymns,Golden-hued Soma, being cleansed, hath reached the bowls. After thy Godlike qualities, associate with Indra, go,As a Priest purified by priests, Immortal One. Like a car-horse who shows his strength, a God effused for Deities.The penetrating Pavamana flows along.
