==================================================

. WITH hymns I call you, when the Sun hath risen, Mitra, and Varuṇa whose thoughts are holy,Whose Power Divine, supreme and everlasting, comes with good heed at each man's supplication. For they are Asuras of Gods, the friendly make, both of you, our lands exceeding fruitful.May we obtain you, Varuṇa and Mitra, wherever Heaven and Earth and days may bless us. Bonds of the sinner, they bear many nooses: the wicked mortal hardly may escape them.Varuṇa-Mitra, may your path of Order bear us o’er trouble as a boat o’er waters. Come, taste our offering, Varuṇa and Mitra: bedew our pasture wil sweet food and fatness.Pour down in plenty here upon the people the choicest of your fair celestial water. To you this laud, O Varuṇa and Mitra, is offered, like bright Soma juice to Vāyu.Favour our songs of praise, wake thought and spirit. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
