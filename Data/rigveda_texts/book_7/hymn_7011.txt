==================================================

. GREAT art thou, Agni, sacrifice's Herald: not without thee are deathless Gods made joyful.Come hither with all Deities about thee here take thy seat, the first, as Priest, O Agni. Men with oblations evermore entreat thee, the swift, to undertake an envoy's duty.He on whose sacred grass with Gods thou sittest, to him, O Agni, are the days propitious. Three times a day in thee are shown the treasures sent for the mortal who presents oblation.Bring the Gods hither like a man, O Agni: be thou our envoy, guarding us from curses. Lord of the lofty sacrifice is Agni, Agni is Lord of every gift presented.The Vasus were contented with his wisdom, so the Gods made him their oblationbearer. O Agni, bring the Gods to taste our presents: with Indra leading, here let them be joyful.Convey this sacrifice to Gods in heaven. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.
