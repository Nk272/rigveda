==================================================

. LET me not yet, King Varuṇa, enter into the house of clay:Have mercy, spare me, Mighty Lord. When, Thunderer! I move along tremulous like a wind-blown skin,Have mercy, spare me, Mighty Lord. O Bright and Powerful God, through want of strength I erred and went astrayHave mercy, spare me, Mighty Lord. Thirst found thy worshipper though he stood in the midst of water-fijods:Have mercy, spare me, Mighty Lord. O Varuṇa, whatever the offence may be which we as men commit against the heavenly host,When through our want of thought we violate thy laws, punish us not, O God, for that iniquity.
