==================================================

 THE priests, Vasisthas, are the first awakened to welcome Uá¹£as with their songs and praises,Who makes surrounding regions part asunder,and shows apparent all existing creatures. Giving fresh life when she hath hid the darkness, this Dawn hath wakened there with new-born lustre.Youthful and unrestrained she cometh forward: she hath turned thoughts to Sun and fire and worship. May blessed Mornings shine on us for ever, with wealth of kine, of horses, and of heroes,Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
