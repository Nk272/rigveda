==================================================

. AGNI at dawn, and Indra we invoke at dawn, and Varuṇa and Mitra, and the Aśvins twain.Bhaga at dawn, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, Soma at dawn, Rudra we will invoke at dawn. We will invoke strong, early-conquering Bhaga, the Son of Aditi, the great supporter:Thinking of whom, the poor, yea, even the mighty, even the King himself says, Give me Bhaga. Bhaga our guide, Bhaga whose gifts are faithful, favour this song, and give us wealth, O Bhaga.Bhaga, augment our store of kine and horses, Bhaga, may we be rich in men and heroes. So may felicity be ours at present, and when the day approaches, and at noontide;And may we still, O Bounteous One, at sunset be happy in the Deities' loving-kindness. May Bhaga verily be bliss-bestower, and through him, Gods! may happiness attend us.As such, O Bhaga, all with might invoke thee: as such be thou our Champion here, O Bhaga. To this our worship may all Dawns incline them, and come to the pure place like Dadhikrāvan.As strong steeds draw a chariot may they bring us hitherward Bhaga who discovers treasure. May blessed Mornings dawn on us for ever, with wealth of kine, of horses, and of heroes,Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
