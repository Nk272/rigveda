==================================================

. THESE morning sacrifices call you, Aśvins, at the break of day.For help have I invoked you rich in power and might: for, house by house ye visit all. O Heroes, ye bestow wonderful nourishment. send it to him whose songs are sweetAccordant, both of you, drive your car down to us, and drink the savoury Soma juice. Approach ye and be near to us. drink, O ye Aśvins, of the meath.Draw forth the milk, ye Mighty, rich in genuine wealth: injure us not, and come to us. The horses that convey you in their rapid flight down to the worshipper's abode,With these your speedy coursers, Heroes, Aśvins, come, ye Gods, come well-inclined to us. Yea, verily, our princes seek the Aśvins in pursuit of food.These shall give lasting glory to our liberal lords, and, both Nāsatyas, shelter us. Those who have led the way, like cars, offending none, those who are guardians of the men-Also through their own might the heroes have grown strong, and dwell in safe and happy homes.
