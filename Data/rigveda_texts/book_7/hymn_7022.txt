==================================================

. DRINK Soma, Lord of Bays, and let it cheer thee: Indra, the stone, like a well guided courser,Directed by the presser's arms hath pressed it. So let the draught of joy, thy dear companion, by which, O Lord of Bays, thou slayest foemen,Delight thee, Indra, Lord of princely treasures. Mark closely, Maghavan, the words I utter, this eulogy recited by Vasiṣṭha:Accept the prayers I offer at thy banquet. Hear thou the call of the juice-drinking press-stone: hear thou the Brahman's hymn who sings and lauds thee.Take to thine inmost self these adorations. I know and ne’er forget the hymns and praises of thee, the Conqueror, and thy strength immortal.Thy name I ever utter. Self-Refulgent Among mankind many are thy libations, and many a time the pious sageinvokes thee.O Maghavan, be not long distant from us. All these libations are for thee, O Hero: to thee I offer these my prayers. that strengthen.Ever, in every place, must men invoke thee. Never do men attain, O Wonder-Worker, thy greatness, Mighty One, who must be lauded,Nor, Indra, thine heroic power and bounty. Among all Ṛṣis, Indra, old and recent, who have engendered hymns as sacred singers,Even with us be thine auspicious friendships. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.
