==================================================

. ACKNOWLEDGE us, O Guardian of the Homestead: bring no disease, and give us happy entrance.Whateâ€™er we ask of thee, be pleased to grant it, and prosper thou quadrupeds and bipeds. Protector of the Home, be our promoter: increase our wealth in kine and steeds, O Indu.May we be ever-youthful in thy friendship: be pleased in us as in his sons a father. Through thy dear fellowship that bringeth welfare, may we be victors, Guardian of the Dwelling!Protect our happiness in rest and labour. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
