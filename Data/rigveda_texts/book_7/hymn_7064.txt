==================================================

. YE Twain who rule, in heaven and earth, the region, clothed be your clouds in robes of oil and fatness.May the imperial Varuṇa, and Mitra, and high-born Aryaman accept our presents. Kings, guards of rrtighty everlasting Order, come hitherward, ye Princes, Lords of Rivers.Send us from heaven, O Varuṇa and Mitra, rain and sweet food, ye who pour down your bounties. May the dear God, and Varuṇa and Mitra conduct us by the most effective pathways,That foes may say unto Sudās our chieftain, May, we, too, joy in food with Gods to guard us. Him who hath wrought for you this car in spirit, who makes the song rise upward and sustains it,Bedew with fatness, Varuṇa nd Mitra ye Kings, make glad the pleasant dwelling-places. To you this laud, O Varuṇa and Mitra is offered like bright Soma juice to Vāyu.Favour our songs of praise, wake thought and spirit. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
