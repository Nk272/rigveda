==================================================

. WITH reverence and with offered gifts serve we the God whose flame is bright:Let us bring Jātavedas fuel, and adore Agni when we invoke the Gods. Agni, may we perform thy rites with fuel, and honour thee, O Holy one, with praises:Honour thee, Priest of sacrifice! with butter, thee, God of blessed light! with our oblation. Come, Agni, with the Gods to our invoking, come, pleased, to offerings sanctified with Vaṣaṭ.May we be his who pays thee, God, due honour. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.
