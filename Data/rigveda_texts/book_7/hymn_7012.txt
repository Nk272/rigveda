==================================================

. WE with great reverence have approached The Youngest who hath shone forth well-kindled in his dwelling,With wondrous light between wide earth and heaven, well-worshipped, looking forth in all directions. Through his great might o’ercoming all misfortunes, praised in the house is Agni Jātavedas.May he protect us from disgrace and trouble, both us who laud him and our noble patrons. O Agni, thou art Varuṇa and Mitra: Vasisthas with their holy hymns exalt thee.With thee be most abundant gain of treasure. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.
