==================================================

. STRONG, Godly-natured, born for hero exploit, man's Friend, hedoth whatever deed he willeth.Saving us e’en from great transgression, Indra, the Youthful, visiteth man's home with favour. Waxing greatness Indra slayeth Vṛtra: the Hero with his aid hath helped the singer.He gave Sudās wide room and space, and often hath granted wealth to him who brought oblations. Soldier unchecked, war-rousing, battling Hero, unconquered from of old, victorious ever,Indra the very strong hath scattered armies; yea, he hath slain each foe who fought against him. Thou with thy greatness hast filled full, O Indra, even both the worlds with might, O thou Most Mighty.Lord of Bays, Indra, brandishing his thunder, is gratified with Soma at the banquet. A Bull begat the Bull for joy of battle, and a strong Mother brought forth him the manly.He who is Chief of men, their armies' Leader, is strong Hero, bold, and fain for booty. The people falter not, nor suffer sorrow, who win themselves this God's terrific spirit.He who with sacrifices worships Indra is lord of wealth, law-born and law's protector. Whene’er the elder fain would help the younger the greater cometh to the lesser's present.Shall the Immortal sit aloof' inactive? O Wondrous Indra, bring us wondrous riches. Thy dear folk, Indra, who present oblations, are, in chief place, thy friends, O Thunder-wielder.May we be best content in this thy favour, sheltered by One who slays not, but preserves us. To thee the mighty hymn hath clamoured loudly, and, Maghavan, the eloquent hath besought thee.Desire of wealth hath come upon thy singer: help us then, gakra, to our share of riches. Place us by food which thou hast given, O Indra, us and the wealthy patrons who command us.Let thy great power bring good to him who lauds thee. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.
