==================================================

. O VARUNA and Mitra, Sūrya spreading the beauteous light of you Twain Gods ariseth.He who beholdetb all existing creatures observetb well the zeal that is in mortals. The holy sage, renowned afar, directeth his hymns to you, O Varuṇa and Mitra,—He whose devotions, sapient Gods, ye favour so that ye fill, as ’twere, with power his autumns. From the wide earth, O Varuṇa and Mitra from the great lofty heaven, ye, Bounteous Givers, -Have in the fields and houses set your warder-, who visit every spot and watch unceasing. I praise the strength of Varuṇa and Mitra that strength, by mightiness, keeps both worlds asunder.Heroless pass the months of the ungodly he who loves sacrifice makes his home enduring. Steers, all infallible are these your people in whom no wondrous thing is seen, no worship.Guile follows close the men who are untruthful: no secrets may be hidden from your knowledge. I will exalt your sacrifice with homage: as priest, I, Mitra-Varuṇa, invoke you.May these new hymns and prayers that I have fashioned delight you to the profit of the singer. This priestly task, Gods! Varuṇa and Mitra! hath been performed for you at sacrifices.Convey us safely over every peril. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
