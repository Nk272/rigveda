==================================================

. WITH power and strength, O Mighty God, approach us: be the augmenter, Indra, of these riches;Strong Thunderer, Lord of men, for potent valour, for manly exploit and for high dominion. Thee, worth invoking, in the din of battle, heroes invoke in fray for life and sunlight.Among all people thou art foremost fighter: give up our enemies to easy slaughter. When fair bright days shall dawn on us, O Indra, and thou shalt bring thy banner near in battle,Agni the Asura shall sit as Herald, calling Gods hither for our great good fortune. Thine are we, Indra, thine, both these who praise thee, and those who give rich gifts, O God and Hero.Grant to our princes excellent protection, may they wax old and still be strong and happy. We will address this liberal Lord, this Indra that he may grant us gifts of ample riches:Best favourer of the singer's prayer and praises. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
