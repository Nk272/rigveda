==================================================

. FOR you I deck a harmless hymn, presenting the Soma juice to Varuṇa and Indra-A hymn that shines like heavenly Dawn with fatness. May they be near us on the march and guard us. Here where the arrows fall amid the banners both hosts invoke the Gods in emulation.O Indra-Varuṇa, smite back those-our foemen,yea, smite them withyour shaft to every quarter. Self-lucid in their seats, e’en heavenly Waters endowed with Godhead Varuṇa and Indra.One of these holds the folk distinct and sundered, the Other smites and slays resistless foemen. Wise be the priest and skilled in Law Eternal, who with his sacred gifts and oration.Brings you to aid us with your might, Ādityas: let him have viands to promote his welfare. May this my song reach Varuṇa and Indra, and, strongly urging, win me sons and offspring.To the Gods’ banquet may we go with riches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods with blessings.
