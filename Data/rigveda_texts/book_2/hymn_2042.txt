==================================================

. TELLING his race aloud with cries repeated, he sends his voice out as his boat a steersman.O Bird, be ominous of happy fortune from no side may calamity befall thee. Let not the falcon kill thee, nor the eagle let not the arrow-bearing archer reach thee.Still crying in the region of the Fathers, speak here auspicious, bearing joyful tidings. Bringing good tidings, Bird of happy omen, call thou out loudly southward of our dwellings,So that no thief, no sinner may oppress us. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.
