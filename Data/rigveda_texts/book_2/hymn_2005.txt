==================================================

. HERALD and teacher was he born, a guardian for our patronsâ€™ help,Earner by rites of noble wealth. That Strong One may we grasp and guide; In whom, Leader of sacrifice, the seven reins, far extended, meet;Who furthers, man-like, eighth in place, as Cleanser, all the work divine. When swift he follows this behest, bird-like he chants the holy prayers.He holds all knowledge in his grasp even as the felly rounds the wheel. Together with pure mental power, pure, as Director, was he born.Skilled in his own unchanging laws he waxes like the growing boughs. Clothing them in his hues, the kine of him the Leader wait on him.Is he not better than the Three, the Sisters who have come to us? When, laden with the holy oil, theSisterby the Mother stands,The Priest delights in their approach, as corn at coming of the rain. For his support let him perform as ministrant his priestly task;Yea, song of praise and sacrifice: we have bestowed, let us obtain. That so this man well skilled, may pay worship to all the Holy Ones.And, Agni, this our sacrifice which we have here prepared, to thee.
