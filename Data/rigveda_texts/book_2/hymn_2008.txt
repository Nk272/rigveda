==================================================

. Now praise, as one who strives for strength, the harnessing of Agni's car,The liberal, the most splendid One; Who, guiding worshippers aright, withers, untouched by age, the foe:When worshipped fair to look upon; Who for his glory is extolled at eve and morning in our homes,Whose statute is inviolate; Who shines refulgent like the Sun, with brilliance and with fiery flame,Decked with imperishable sheen. Him Atri, Agni, have our songs Strengthened according to his sway:All glories hath he made his own. May we with Agni's, Indra's help, with Soma's, yea, of all the Gods,Uninjured dwell together still, and conquer those who fight with us.
