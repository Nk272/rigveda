==================================================

. AGNI, accept this flaming brand, this waiting with my prayer on thee:Hear graciously these songs of praise. With this hymn let us honour thee, seeker of horses, Son of Strength,With this fair hymn, thou nobly born. As such, lover of song, with songs, wealth-lover, giver of our wealth!With reverence let us worship thee. Be thou for us a liberal Prince, giver and Lord of precious things.Drive those who hate us far away. Such as thou art, give rain from heaven, give strength which no man may resist:Give food exceeding plentiful. To him who lauds thee, craving help, most youthful envoy! through our song,Most holy Herald! come thou nigh. Between both races, Agni, Sage, well skilled thou passest to and fro,As envoy friendly to mankind. Befriend us thou as knowing all. Sage, duly worship thou the Gods,And seat thee on this sacred grass.
