==================================================

. VASU, thou most youthful God, Bhārata, Agni, bring us wealth,Excellent, splendid, much-desired. Let no malignity prevail against us, either God's or man's.Save us from this and enmity. So through thy favour may we force through all our enemies a way,As ’twere through streaming water-floods. Thou, Purifier Agni, high shinest forth, bright, adorable,When worshipped with the sacred oil. Ours art thou, Agni, Bhārata, honoured by us with barren cows,With bullocks and with kine in calf Wood-fed, bedewed with sacred oil, ancient, Invoker, excellent,The Son of Strength, the Wonderful.
