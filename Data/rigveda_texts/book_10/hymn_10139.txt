==================================================

. SAVITAR, golden-haired, hath lifted eastward, bright With the sunbeams, his eternal lustre;He in whose energy wise Pūṣan marches, surveying all existence like a herdsman. Beholding men he sits amid the heaven filling the two world-halves and air's wide region.He looks upon the rich far-spreading pastures between the eastern and the western limit. He, root of wealth, the gatherer-up of treasures, looks with his might on every form and figure.Savitar, like a Godẉhose Law is constant, stands in the battle for the spoil like Indra. Waters from sacrifice came to the Gandharva Visvavasu, O Soma, when they saw him.Indra, approaching quickly, marked their going, and looked around upon the Sun's enclosures. This song Visvavasu shall sing us, meter of air's mid-realm celestial Gandharva,That we may know aright both truth and falsehood: may he inspire our thoughts and help our praises. In the floods' track he found the bootyseeker: the rocky cow-pen's doors he threw wide open.These, the Gandharva told him, Rowed with Amṛta. Indra knew well the puissancc of the dragons.
