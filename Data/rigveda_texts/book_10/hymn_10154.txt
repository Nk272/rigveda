==================================================

. FOR some is Soma purified, some sit by sacrificial oil:To those for whom the meath flows forth, even to those let him depart. Invincible through Fervour, those whom Fervour hath advanced to heaven,Who showed great Fervour in their lives, -even to those let him depart. The heroes who contend in war and boldly cast their lives away,Or who give guerdon thousandfold, -even to those let him depart. Yea, the first followers of Law, Law's pure and holy strengtheners,The Fathers, Yama! Fervour-moved,even to those let him depart. Skilled in a thousand ways and means, the sages who protect the Sun,The Ṛṣis, Yama! Fervour-moved,—even to those let him depart.
