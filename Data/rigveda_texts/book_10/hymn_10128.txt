==================================================

. LET me win glory, Agni, in our battles: enkindling thee, may we support our bodies.May the four regions bend and bow before me: with thee for guardian may we win in combat. May all the Gods be on my side in battle, the Maruts led by Indra, Viṣṇu, Agni.Mine be the middle air's extended region, and may the wind blow favouring these my wishes. May the Gods grant me riches; may the blessing and invocation of the Gods assist me.Foremost in fight be the divine Invokers: may we, unwounded, have brave heroes round us. For me let them present all mine oblations, and let my mind's intention be accomplished.May I he guiltless of the least transgression: and, all ye Gods, do ye combine to bless us. Ye six divine Expanses, grant us freedom: here, all ye Gods, acquit yourselves like heroes.Let us not lose our children or our bodies: let us not benefit the foe, King Soma! Baffling the wrath of our opponents, Agni, guard us as our infallible Protector.Let these thy foes turn back and seek their houses, and let their thought who watch at home be ruined. Lord of the world, Creator of creators the saviour God who overcomes the foeman.May Gods, Bṛhaspati, both Aśvins shelter from ill this sacrifice and sacrificer. Foodful, and much-invoked, at this our calling may the great Bull vouchsafe us wide protection.Lord of Bay Coursers, Indra, blew our children: harm us not, give us not as prey to others. Let those who are our foemen stay. afar from us: with Indra and with Agni we will drive them off.Vasus, Ādityas, Rudras have exalted me, made me far-reaching, mighty, thinker, sovran lord.
