==================================================

. FILLING our hearts with health and joy, may Vāta breathe his balm on usMay he prolong our days of life. Thou art our Father, Vāta, yea, thou art a Brother and a friend,So give us strength that we may live. The store of Amṛta laid away yonder, O Vāta, in thine home,—Give us thereof that we may live.
