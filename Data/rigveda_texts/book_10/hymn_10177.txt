==================================================

. THE sapient with their spirit and their mind behold the Bird adorned with all an Asura's magic might.Sages observe him in the ocean's inmost depth: the wise disposers seek the station of his rays. The flying Bird bears Speech within his spirit: erst the Gandharva in the womb pronounced it:And at the seat of sacrifice the sages cherish this radiant, heavenly-bright invention. I saw the Herdsman, him who never resteth, approaching and departing on his pathways.He, clothed in gathered and diffusive splendour, within the worlds continually travels.
