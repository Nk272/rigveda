==================================================

. AVAUNT, thou Master of the mind Depart, and vanish far away.Look on Destruction far from hence. The live man's mind is manifold. A happy boon do men elect, a mighty blessing they obtain.Bliss with Vaivasvata they see. The live man's mind seeks many a place. If by address, by blame, by imprecation we have committed sin, awake or sleeping,All hateful acts of ours, all evil doings may Agni bear away to distant places. When, Indra, Brahmaṇaspati, our deeds are wrongful and unjust,May provident Aṅgirasa prevent our foes from troubling, us. We have prevailed this day and won: we are made free from sin and guilt.Ill thoughts, that visit us awake or sleeping, seize the man we hate, yea, seize the man who hateth us.
