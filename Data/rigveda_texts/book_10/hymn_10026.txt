==================================================

. FORWARD upon their way proceed the ready teams, the lovely songs.Further them glorious Pūṣan with yoked chariot, and the Mighty Twain! With sacred hymns let this man here, this singer, win the God to whomBelong this majesty and might. He hath observed our eulogies. Pūṣan the Strong hath knowledge of sweet praises even as Indu hath.He dews our corn with moisture, he bedews the pasture of our kine. We will bethink ourselves of thee, O Pūṣan, O thou God, as One.Who brings fulfilment of our hymns, and stirs the singer and the sage. joint-sharer of each sacrifice, the driver of the chariot steeds;The Ṛṣi who is good to man, the singer's Friend and faithful Guard. One who is Lord of Suca, Lord of Suca caring for herself:Weaving the raiment of the sheep and making raiment beautiful. The mighty Lord of spoil and wealth, Strong Friend of all prosperity;He with light movement shakes his beard, lovely and ne’er to be deceived. O Pūṣan, may those goats of thine turn hitherward thy chariot-pole.Friend of all suppliants; art thou, born in old time, and arm and sure. May the majestic Pūṣan speed our chariot with his power and might.May he increase our store of wealth and listen to this call of ours.
