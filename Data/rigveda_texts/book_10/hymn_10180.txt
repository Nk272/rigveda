==================================================

. O MUCH-INVOKED, thou hast subdued thy foemen: thy might is loftiest; here display thy bounty.In thy right hand, O Indra, bring us treasures: thou art the Lord of rivers filled with riches. Like a dread wild beast roaming on the mountain thou hast approached us from the farthest distance.Whetting thy bold and thy sharp blade, O Indra, crush thou the foe and scatter those who hate us. Thou, mighty Indra, sprangest into being as strength for lovely lordship oâ€™er the people.Thou drovest off the folk who were unfriendly, and to the Gods thou gavest room and freedom.
