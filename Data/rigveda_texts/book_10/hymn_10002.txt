==================================================

. GLADDEN the yearning Gods, O thou Most Youthful: bring them, O Lord of Seasons, knowing seasons,With all the Priests Celestial, O Agni. Best worshipper art thou of all Invokers. Thine is the Herald's, thine the Cleanser's office, thinker art thou, wealth-giver, true to Order.Let us with Svāhā offer up oblations, and Agni, worthy God, pay the Gods worship. To the Gods’ pathway have we travelled, ready to execute what work we may accomplish.Let Agni, for he knows, complete the worship. He is the Priest: let him fix rites and seasons. When we most ignorant neglect the statutes of you, O Deities with whom is knowledge,Wise Agni shall correct our faults and failings, skilled to assign each God his fitting season. When, weak in mind, of feeble understanding, mortals bethink them not of sacrificing,Then shall the prudent and discerning Agni worship the Gods, best worshipper, in season. Because the Father hath produced thee, Leader of all our solemn rites, their brilliant Banner:So win by worship pleasant homes abounding in heroes, and rich food to nourish all men. Thou whom the Heaven and Earth, thou whom the Waters, and Tvaṣṭar, maker of fair things, created,Well knowing, all along the Fathers' pathway, shine with resplendent light, enkindled, Agni.
