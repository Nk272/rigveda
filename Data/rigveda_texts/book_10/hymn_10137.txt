==================================================

. YE Gods, raise up once more the man whom ye have humbled and brought low.O Gods, restore to life again the man who hatb committed sin. Two several winds are blowing here, from Sindhu, from a distant land.May one breathe energy to thee, the other blow disease away. Hither, O Wind, blow healing balm, blow all disease away, thou Wind;For thou who hast all medicine comest as envoy of the Gods. I am come nigh to thee with balms to give thee rest and keep thee safe.I bring thee blessed strength, I drive thy weakening malady away. Here let the Gods deliver him, the Maruts’ band deliver him:All things that be deliver him that he be freed from his disease. The Waters have their healing power, the Waters drive disease away.The Waters have a balm for all: let them make medicine for thee. The tongue that leads the voice precedes. Then with our ten-fold branching hands,With these two chasers of disease we stroke thee with a gentle touch.
