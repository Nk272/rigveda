==================================================

. YON Sun hath mounted up, and this my happy fate hate mounted high.I knowing this, as conqueror have won my husband for mine own. I am the banner and the head, a mighty arbitress am I:I am victorious, and my Lord shall be submissive to my will. My Sons are slayers of the foe, my Daughter is a ruling Queen:I am victorious: o’er my Lord my song of triumph is supreme. Oblation, that which Indra gave and thus grew glorious and most high,—This have I offered, O ye Gods, and rid me of each rival wife. Destroyer of the rival wife, Sole Spouse, victorious, conqueror,The others' glory have I seized as ’twere the wealth of weaker Dames. I have subdued as conqueror these rivals, these my fellow-wives,That I may hold imperial sway over this Hero and the folk.
