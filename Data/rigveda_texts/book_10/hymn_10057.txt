==================================================

. LET us not, Indra, leave the path, the Soma-presser's sacrifice:Let no malignity dwell with us. May we obtain, completely wrought, the thread spun out to reach the Gods,That perfecteth the sacrifice. We call the spirit hither with the Soma of our parted sires,Yea, with the Fathers' holy hymns. Thy spirit come to thee again for wisdom, energy, and lire,That thou mayst long behold the sun! O Fathers, may the Heavenly Folk give us our spirit once again,That we may be with those who live. O Soma with the spirit still within us, blest with progeny,May we be busied in the law.
