==================================================

. MAY Viṣṇu form and mould the womb, may Tvaṣṭar duly shape the forms,Prajāpati infuse the stream, and Dhātar lay the germ for thee. O Sinīvālī, set the germ, set thou the germ, Sarasvatī:May the Twain Gods bestow the germ, the Aśvins crowned with lotuses. That which the Aśvins Twain rub forth with the attrition-sticks of gold,—That germ of thine we invocate, that in the tenth month thou mayst bear.
