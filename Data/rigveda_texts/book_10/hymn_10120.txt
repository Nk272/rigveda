==================================================

. IN all the worlds That was the Best and Highest whence sprang the Mighty Gods, of splendid valour.As soon as born he overcomes his foemen, be in whom all who lend him aid are joyful. Grown mighty in his strength, with ample vigour, he as a foe strikes fear into the Dāsa,Eager to win the breathing and the breathless. All sang thy praise at banquet and oblation. All concentrate on thee their mental vigour, what time these, twice or thrice, are thine assistants.Blend what is sweeter than the sweet with sweetness: win. quickly with our meath that meath in battle. Therefore in thee too, thou who winnest riches, at every banquet are the sages joyful.With mightier power, Bold God, extend thy firmness: let not malignant Yātudhānas harm thee. Proudly we put our trust in thee in battles, when we behold great wealth the prize of combat.I with my words impel thy weapons onward, and sharpen with my prayer thy vital vigour. Worthy of praises, many-shaped, most skilful, most energetic, Āptya of the Aptyas:He with his might destroys the seven Danus, subduing many who were deemed his equals. Thou in that house which thy protection guardeth bestowest wealth, the higher and the lower.Thou stablishest the two much-wandering Mothers, and bringest many deeds to their completion. Brhaddiva, the foremost of light-winners, repeats these holy prayers, this strength of Indra.He rules the great self-luminous fold of cattle, and all the doors of light hath he thrown open. Thus hath Brhaddiva, the great Atharvan, spoken to Indra as himself in person.The spotless Sisters, they who are his Mothers, with power exalt him and impel him onward.
