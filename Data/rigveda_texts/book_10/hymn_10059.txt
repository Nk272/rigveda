==================================================

. His life hath been renewed and carried forward as two men, car-borne, by the skilful driver.One falls, then seeks the goal with quickened vigour. Let Nirrti depart to distant places. Here is the psalm for wealth, and food, in plenty: let us do many deeds to bring us glory.All these our doings shall delight the singer. Let Nirrti depart to distant places. May we o’ercome our foes with acts of valour, as heaven is over earth, hills over lowlands.All these our deeds the singer hath considered. Let Nirrti depart to distant places. Give us not up as prey to death, O Soma still let us look upon the Sun arising.Let our old age with passing days be kindly. Let Nirrti depart to distant places. O Asuniti, keep the soul within us, and make the days we have to live yet longer.Grant that we still may look upon the sunlight: strengthen thy body with the oil we bring thee. Give us our sight again, O Asuniti, give us again our breath and our enjoyment.Long may we look upon the Sun uprising; O Anumati, favour thou and bless us. May Earth restore to us our vital spirit, may Heaven the Goddess and mid-air restore it.May Soma give us once again our body, and Pūṣan show the Path of peace and comfort. May both Worlds bless Subandhu, young Mothers of everlasting Law.May Heaven and Earth uproot and sweep iniquity and shame away: nor sin nor sorrow trouble thee. Health-giving medicines descend sent down from heaven in twos and threes,Or wandering singly on the earth. May Heaven and Earth uproot and sweep iniquity and shame away: nor sin nor sorrow trouble thee. Drive forward thou the wagon-ox, O Indra, which brought Usinarani's wagon hither.May Heaven and Earth uproot and sweep iniquity and shame away: nor sin nor sorrow trouble thee.
