==================================================

. LET songs of ours speed Agni forth like a fleet courser in the race,And we will win each prize through him. Agni the dart whereby we gain kine for ourselves with help from thee,â€”That send us for the gain of wealth. O Agni, bring us wealth secure, vast wealth in horses and in kine:Oil thou the socket, turn the wheel. O Agni, thou hast made the Sun, Eternal Star, to mount the sky,Bestowing light on living men. Thou, Agni, art the people's light, best, dearest, seated in thy shrine:Watch for the singer, give him life.
