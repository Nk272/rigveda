==================================================

. FROM both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and from thy chin,Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away. From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones and from the spine,From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away. From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the heart,From kidneys, liver, and from spleen, I drive thy malady away. From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the forepart of the feet,From hips from stomach, and from groin I drive thy malady away. From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from they nails,From all thyself from top to toe, I drive thy malady away. From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every joint,From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
