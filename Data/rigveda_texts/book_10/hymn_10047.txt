==================================================

. THY right hand have we grasped in ours, O Indra, longing for treasure, Treasure-Lord of treasures!Because we know thee, Hero, Lord of cattle: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches. Wealth, fully armed, good guard and kind protector, sprung from four seas, the prop and stay of treasures,Fraught with great bounties, meet for praise and glory; vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches. Wealth, with good Brahmans, Indra! God-attended, high, wide, and deep, arid based on broad foundations,Strong, with famed Ṛṣis, conquering our foemen: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches. Victorious, winning strength, with hero sages, confirmed in power, most useful, wealth-attracting,True, Indra! crushing forts and slaying Dasyus: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches. Wealthy in heroes and in cars and horses, strength hundredfold and thousandfold, O Indra,With manly sages, happy troops, Iight-winning: vouchsafe us mighty and resplentdent riches. To Saptagu the sage, the holy-minded, to him, Bṛhaspati, the song approaches,Aṅgiras' Son who must be met with homage: vouchsafe us mighty and reslendent riches. My lauds, like envoys, craving loving-kindness, go forth to Indra with their strong entreaty,Moving his heart and uttered by my spirit: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches. Grant us the boon for which I pray, O Indra, a spacious home unmatched among the people.To this may Heaven and Earth accord approval: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches.
