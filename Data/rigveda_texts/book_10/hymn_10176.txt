==================================================

. WITH hymns of praise their sons have told aloud the Ṛbhus' mighty deeds.Who, all-supporting, have enjoyed the earth as, twere a mother cow. Bring forth the God with song divine, being Jātavedas hitherward,To bear our gifts at once to heaven. He here, a God-devoted Priest, led forward comes to sacrifice.Like a car covered for the road, he, glowing, knows, himself, the way. This Agni rescues from distress, as ’twere from the Immortal Race,A God yet mightier than strength, a God who hath been made for life.
