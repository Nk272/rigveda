==================================================

. TVASTAR prepares the bridal of his Daughter: all the world hears the tidings and assembles.But Yama's Mother, Spouse of great Vivasvān, vanished as she was carried to her dwelling. From mortal men they hid the Immortal Lady, made one like her and gave her to Vivasvān.Saranyu brought to him the Aśvin brothers, and then deserted both twinned pairs of children. Guard of the world, whose cattle ne’er are injured, may Pūṣan bear thee hence, for he hath knowledge.May he consign thee to these Fathers' keeping, and to the gracious Gods let Agni give thee. May Āyu, giver of all life, protect thee, and bear thee forward on the distant pathway.Thither let Savitar the God transport thee, where dwell the pious who have passed-before thee. Pūṣan knows all these realms: may he conduct us by ways that are most free from fear and danger.Giver of blessings, glowing, all-heroic, may he, thewise and watchful, go before us. Pūṣan was born to move on distant pathways, on the road far from earth and far from heaven.To both most wonted places of assembly he travels and returns with perfect knowledge. The pious call Sarasvatī, they worship Sarasvatī while sacrifice proceedeth.The pious called Sarasvatī aforetime. Sarasvatī send bliss to him who giveth. Sarasvatī, who camest with the Fathers, with them rejoicing thee in our oblations,Seated upon this sacred grass be joyful, and give us strengthening food that brings no sickness. Thou, called on as Sarasvatī by Fathers who come right forward to our solemn service,Give food and wealth to present sacrificers, a portion, worth a thousand, of refreshment. The Mother Floods shall make us bright and shining, cleansers of holy oil, with oil shall cleanse us:For, Goddesses, they bear off all defilement: I, rise up from them purified and brightened. Through days of earliest date the Drop descended on this place and on that which was before it.I offer up, throughout the seven oblations, the Drop which still to one same place is moving. The Drop that falls, thy stalk which arms have shaken, which from the bosom of the press hath fallen,Or from the Adhvaryu's purifying filter, I offer thee with heart and cry of Vaṣaṭ! That fallen Drop of thine, the stalk which from the ladle fell away,This present God Bṛhaspati shall pour it forth to make us rich. The plants of earth are rich in milk, and rich in milk is this my speech;And rich in milk the essence of the Waters: make me pure therewith.
