==================================================

. Now send ye Jātavedas forth, send hitherward the vigorous SteedTo seat him on our sacred grass.. I raise the lofty eulogy of Jātavedas, raining boons,With sages for his hero band. With flames of Jātavedas which carry oblation to the Gods,May he promote our sacrifice.
