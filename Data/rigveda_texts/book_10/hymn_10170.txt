==================================================

. MAY the Bright God drink glorious Soma-mingled meath, giving the sacrifice's lord uninjured life;He who, wind-urged, in person guards our offspring well, hath nourished them with food and shines o’er many a land. Radiant, as high Truth, cherished, best at winning strength, Truth based upon the statute that supports the heavens,He rose, a light, that kills Vṛtras and enemies, best slayer of the Dasyus, Asuras, and foes. This light, the best of lights, supreme, all-conquering, winner of riches, is exalted with high laud.All-lighting, radiant, mighty as the Sun to see, he spreadeth wide unfailing victory and strength. Beaming forth splendour with thy light, thou hast attained heaven's lustrous realm.By thee were brought together all existing things, possessor of all Godhead, All-effecting God.
