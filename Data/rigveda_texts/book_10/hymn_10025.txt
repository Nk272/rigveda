==================================================

. SEND us a good and happy mind, send energy and mental power.Then-at your glad carouse-let men joy in thy love, Sweet juice! as kine in pasture. Thou. art waxing great. rn all thy forms, O Soma, rest thy powers that influence the heart.So also these my longings-at your glad carouse-spread themselves seeking riches. Thou art waxing great. Even if, O Soma, I neglect thy laws through my simplicity,Be gracious-at your glad carouse-as sire to son. Preserve us even from slaughter. T'hou. art waxing great. Our songs in concert go to thee as streams of water to the wells.Soma, that we may live, grant-at your glad carouse-full powers of mind, like beakers. Thou art waxing great. O Soma, through thy might who art skilful and strong, these longing men,These sages, have thrown open-at your glad carouse-the stall of kine and horses. Thou art waxing great Our herds thou guardest, Soma, and the moving world spread far and wide.Thou fittest them for living,—at your glad carouse-looking upon all beings. Thou art waxing great. On all sides, Soma, be to us a Guardian ne’er to be deceived.King, drive away our foemen-at your glad carouse:—let not the wicked rule us. Thou art waxing great. Be watchful, Soma, passing wise, to give us store of vital strength.More skilled than man to guide us,—at your glad carouse-save us from harm and sorrow. Thou art waxing great. Chief slayer of our foemen, thou, Indu, art Indra's gracious Friend,When warriors invoke him-at your glad carouse -in fight, to win them offspring. Thou art waxing great. Victorious is this gladdening drink: to Indra dear it grows in strength.This-at your glad carouse -enhanced the mighty hymn of the great sage Kakṣīvān. Thou art waxing great. This to the sage who offers gifts brings power that comes from wealth in kine.This, better than the seven, hath-at your glad carouse-furthered the blind, the cripple. Thou art waxing great.
