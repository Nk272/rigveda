==================================================

. To Agni send I forth my song, to him the Bull of all the folk:So may he bear us past our foes. Who from the distance far away shines brilliantly across the wastes:So may he bear us past our foes. The Bull with brightly-gleaming flame who utterly consumes the fiendsSo may he bear us past our foes. Who looks on all existing things and comprehends them with his view:So may he bear us past our foes. Resplendent Agni, who was born in farthest region of the air:So may he bear us past our foes.
