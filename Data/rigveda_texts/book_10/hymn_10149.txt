==================================================

. SAVITAR fixed the earth with bands to bind it, and made heaven stedfast where no prop supported.Savitar milked, as ’twere a restless courser, air, sea bound fast to what no foot had trodden. Well knoweth Savitar, O Child of Waters, where ocean, firmly fixt, o’erflowed its limit.Thence sprang the world, from that uprose the region: thence heaven spread out and the wide earth expanded. Then, with a full crowd of Immortal Beings, this other realm came later, high and holy.First, verily, Savitar's strong-pinioned Eagle was born: and he obeys his law for ever. As warriors to their steeds, kine to their village, as fond milk giving cows approach their youngling,As man to wife, let Savitar come downward to us, heaven's bearer, Lord of every blessing. Like the Aṅgirasa Hiranvastupa, I call thee, Savitar, to this achievement:So worshipping and lauding thee for favour I watch for thee as for the stalk of Soma.
