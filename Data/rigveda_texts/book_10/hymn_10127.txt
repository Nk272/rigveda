==================================================

. WITH all her eyes the Goddess Night looks forth approaching many a spot:She hath put all her glories on. Immortal. she hath filled the waste, the Goddess hath filled height and depth:She conquers darkness with her light. The Goddess as she comes hath set the Dawn her Sister in her place:And then the darkness vanishes. So favour us this night, O thou whose pathways we have visitedAs birds their nest upon the tree. The villagers have sought their homes, and all that walks and all that flies,Even the falcons fain for prey. Keep off the she-wolf and the wolf, O Urmya, keep the thief away;Easy be thou for us to pass. Clearly hath she come nigh to me who decks the dark with richest hues:O Morning, cancel it like debts. These have I brought to thee like kine. O Night, thou Child of Heaven, acceptThis laud as for a conqueror.
