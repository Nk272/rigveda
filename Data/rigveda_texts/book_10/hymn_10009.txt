==================================================

. YE, Waters, are beneficent: so help ye us to energyThat we may look on great delight. Give us a portion of the sap, the most auspicious that ye have,Like mothers in their longing love. To you we gladly come for him to whose abode ye send us on;And, Waters, give us procreant strength. The Waters. be to us for drink, Goddesses for our aid and bliss:Let them stream to us health and strength. beg the Floods to give us balm, these Queens who rule oâ€™er precious things,And have supreme control of men. Within the Waters-Soma thus hath told me-dwell all balms that heal,And Agni, he who blesseth all. O Waters, teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm,So that I long may see the Sun. Whatever sin is found in me, whatever evil I have wrought,If I have lied or falsely sworn, Waters, remove it far from me. The Waters I this day have sought, and to their moisture have we come:O Agni, rich in milk, come thou, and with thy splendour cover me.
