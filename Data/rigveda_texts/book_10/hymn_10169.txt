==================================================

. MAY the wind blow upon our Cows with healing: may they eat herbage full of vigorous juices.May they drink waters rich in life and fatness: to food that moves on feet be gracious, Rudra. Like-coloured, various-hued, or single-coloured, whose names through sacrifice are known to Agni,Whom the Aṅgirases produced by Fervour,—vouchsafe to these, Parjanya, great protection. Those who have offered to the Gods their bodies, whose varied forms are all well known to Soma,—Those grant us in our cattle-pen, O Indra, with their full streams of milk and plenteous offspring. Prajāpati, bestowing these upon me, one-minded with all Gods and with the Fathers,Hath to our cow-pen brought auspicious cattle: so may we own the offspring they will bear us.
