==================================================

. BORNE on with thee, O Manyu girt by Maruts, let our brave men, impetuous, bursting forward,March on, like flames of fire in form, exulting, with pointed arrows, sharpening their weapons. Flashing like fire, be thou, O conquering Manyu, invoked, O Victor, as our army's leader.Slay thou our foes, distribute their possessions: show forth thy vigour, scatter those who hate us. O Manyu, overcome thou our assailant on! breaking, slaying, crushing down the foemen.They have not hindered thine impetuous vigour: Mighty, Sole born! thou makest them thy subjects. Alone or many thou art worshipped, Manyu: sharpen the spirit of each clan for battle.With thee to aid, O thou of perfect splendour, we will uplift the glorious shout for conquest. Unyielding bringing victory like Indra, O Manyu, be thou here our Sovran Ruler.To thy dear name, O Victor, we sing praises: we know the spring from which thou art come hither. Twin-born with power, destructive bolt of thunder, the highest conquering might is thine, Subduer!Be friendly to its in thy spirit, Manyu, O Much-invoked, in shock of mighty battle. For spoil let Varuṇa and Manyu give us the wealth of both sides gathered and collected;And let our enemies with stricken spirits, o’erwhelmed with terror, slink away defeated.
