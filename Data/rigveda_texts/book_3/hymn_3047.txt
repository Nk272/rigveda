==================================================

. DRINK, Indra, Marut-girt, as Bull, the Soma, for joy, for rapture even as thou listest.Pour down the flood of meath within thy belly: thou from of old art King of Soma juices. Indra, accordant, with the banded Maruts, drink Soma, Hero, as wise Vṛtra-slayer.Slay thou our foemen, drive away assailants and make us safe on every side from danger. And, drinker at due seasons, drink in season, Indra, with friendly Gods, our pressed-out Soma.The Maruts following, whom thou madest sharers, gave thee the victory, and thou slewest Vṛtra. Drink Soma, Indra, banded with the Maruts who, Maghavan, strengthened thee at Ahi's slaughter,'Gainst Śambara, Lord of Bays! in winning cattle, and now rejoice in thee, the holy Singers. The Bull whose strength hath waxed, whom Maruts follow, free-giving Indra, the celestial Ruler,Mighty, all-conquering, the victory-giver, him let us call to grant us new protection.
