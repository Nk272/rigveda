==================================================

. OF thee, the Bull, the Warrior, Sovran Ruler, joyous and fierce, ancient and ever youthful,The undecaying One who wields the thunder, renowned and great, great are the exploits, Indra. Great art thou, Mighty Lord, through manly vigour, O fierce One, gathering spoil, subduing others,Thyself alone the universe's Sovran: so send forth men to combat and to rest them. He hath surpassed all measure in his brightness, yea, and the Gods, for none may be his equal.Impetuous Indra in his might cxccedcth wide vast mid-air and heaven and earth together. To Indra, even as rivers to the ocean, flow forth from days of old the Soma juices;To him wide deep and mighty from his birth-time, the well of holy thoughts, aIl-comprehending. The Soma, Indra, which the earth and heaven bear for thee as a mother bears her infant,This they send forth to thee, this, vigorous Hero! Adhvaryus purify for thee to drink of.
