==================================================

. INVOKED to drink the Soma juice, come with thy Bay Steeds, Thunder-armedCome, Indra, hitherward to me. Our priest is seated, true to time; the grass is regularly strewn;The pressing-stones were set at morn. These prayers, O thou who hearest prayer are offered: seat thee on the grass.Hero, enjoy the offered cake. O Vá¹›tra-slayer, be thou pleased with these libations, with these hymns,Song-loving Indra, with our lauds. Our hymns caress the Lord of Strength, vast, drinker of the Soma's juice,Indra, as mother-cows their calf. Delight thee with the juice we pour for thine own great munificence:Yield not thy singer to reproach. We, Indra, dearly loving thee, bearing oblation, sing thee hymnsThou, Vasu, dearly lovest us. O thou to whom thy Bays are dear, loose not thy Horses far from us:Here glad thee, Indra, Lord divine. May long-maned Coursers, dropping oil, bring thee on swift car hitherward,Indra, to seat thee on the grass.
