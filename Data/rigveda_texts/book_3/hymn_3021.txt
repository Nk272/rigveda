==================================================

. SET this our sacrifice among the Immortals: be pleased with these our presents, Jātavedas.O Priest, O Agni, sit thee down before us, and first enjoy the drops of oil and fatness. For thee, O Purifier, flow the drops of fatness rich in oil.After thy wont vouchsafe to us the choicest boon that Gods may feast. Agni, Most Excellent! for thee the Sage are drops that drip with oil.Thou art enkindled as the best of Seers. Help thou the sacrifice. To thee, O Agni, mighty and resistless, to thee stream forth the drops of oil and fatness.With great light art thou come, O praised by poets! Accept our offering, O thou Sage. Fatness exceeding rich, extracted from the midst,—this as our gift we offer thee.Excellent God, the drops run down upon thy skin. Deal them to each among the Gods.
