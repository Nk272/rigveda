==================================================

. O INDRA, for the strength that slays Vṛtra and conquers in the fight,We turn thee hitherward to us. O Indra, Lord of Hundred Powers, may those who praise thee hitherward.Direct thy spirit and thine eye. O Indra, Lord of Hundred Powers, with all our songs we invocateThy names for triumph over foes. We strive for glory through the powers immense of him whom many praise,Of Indra who supports mankind. For Vṛtra's slaughter I address Indra whom many invocate,To win us booty in the wars. In battles be victorious. We seek thee, Lord of Hundred Powers,Indra, that Vṛtra may be slain. In splendid combats of the hosts, in glories where the fight is won.Indra, be victor over foes. Drink thou the Soma for our help, bright, vigilant, exceeding strong,O Indra, Lord of Hundred Powers. O Śatakratu, powers which thou mid the Five Races hast displayed-These, Indra, do I claim of thee. Indra, great glory hast thou gained. Win splendid fame which none may marWe make thy might perpetual. Come to us either from anear, Or, Śakra, come from far away.Indra, wherever be thy home, come to us thence, O Thunder-armed.
