==================================================

. AGNI, subdue opposing bands, and drive our enemies away.Invincible, slay godless foes: give splendour to the worshipper. Lit with libation, Agni, thou, deathless, who callest Gods to feast,Accept our sacrifice with joy. With splendour, Agni, Son of Strength, thou who art worshipped, wakeful One.Seat thee on this my sacred grass. With all thy fires, with all the Gods, Agni, exalt the songs we sing.And living men in holy rites. Grant, Agni, to the worshipper wealth rich in heroes, plenteous store,Make thou us rich with many sons.
