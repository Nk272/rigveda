==================================================

. FULL of effectual wisdom Savitar the God hath stretched out golden arms that he may bring forth life.Young and most skilful, while he holds the region up, the Warrior sprinkles fatness over both his hands. May we enjoy the noblest vivifying force of Savitar the God, that he may give us wealth:For thou art mighty to produce and lull to rest the world of life that moves on two feet and on four. Protect our habitation, Savitar, this day, with guardian aids around, auspicious, firm and true.God of the golden tongue, keep us for newest bliss: let not the evil-wisher have us in his power. This Savitar the God, the golden-handed, Friend of the home, hath risen to meet the twilight.With cheeks of brass, with pleasant tongue, the Holy, he sends the worshipper rich gifts in plenty. Like a Director, Savitar hath extended his golden arms, exceeding fair to look on.He hath gone up the heights of earth and heaven, and made each monster fall and cease from troubling. Fair wealth, O Savitar, to-day, to-morrow, fair wealth produce for us each day that passes.May we through this our song be happy gainers, God, of a fair and spacious habitation.
