==================================================

. SON of Deliverance, come, bright God!Let us twain go together: be our charioteer of sacrifice. We pray for wealth to thee most skilled of charioteers, with braided hair,Lord of great riches, and our Friend. Bright God whose steeds are goats, thou art a stream of wealth, a treasure-heap,The Friend of every pious man. Pūṣan, who driveth goats for steeds, the strong and Mighty, who is calledHis Sister's lover, will we laud. His Mother's suitor I address. May he who loves his Sister hear,Brother of Indra, and my Friend. May the sure-footed goats come nigh, conveying Pūṣan on his car,The God who visiteth mankind.
