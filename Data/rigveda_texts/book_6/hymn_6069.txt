==================================================

. INDRA and Viṣṇu, at my task's completion I urge you on with food and sacred service.Accept the sacrifice and grant us riches, leading us on by unobstructed pathways. Ye who inspire all hymns, Indra and Viṣṇu, ye vessels who contain the Soma juices,May hymns of praise that now are sung address you, the lauds that are recited by the singers. Lords of joy-giving draughts, Indra and Viṣṇu, come, giving gifts of treasure, to the Soma.With brilliant rays of hymns let chanted praises, repeated with the lauds, adorn and deck you. May your foe-conquering horses bring you hither, Indra and Viṣṇu, sharers of the banquet.Of all our hymns accept the invocations list to my prayers and hear the songs I sing you. This your deed, Indra-Viṣṇu, must be lauded: widely ye strode in the wild joy of Soma.Ye made the firmament of larger compass, and made the regions broad for our existence. Strengthened with sacred offerings, IndraViṣṇu, first eaters, served with worship ana oblation,Fed with the holy oil, vouchsafe us riches ye are the lake, the vat that holds the Soma. Drink of this meath, O Indra, thou, and Viṣṇu; drink ye your fill of Soma, Wonder-Workers.The sweet exhilarating juice hath reached you. Hear ye my prayers, give ear unto my calling. Ye Twain have conquered, ne’er have yc been conquered: never hath either of the Twain been vanquished.Ye, Indra-Viṣṇu, when ye fought the battle, produced this infinite with three divisions.
