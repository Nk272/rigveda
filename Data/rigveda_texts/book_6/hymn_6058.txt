==================================================

. LIKE heaven art thou: one form is bright, one holy, like Day and Night dissimilar in colour.All magic powers thou aidest, self-depen. dent! Auspicious be thy bounty here, O Pūṣan. Goat-borne, the guard of cattle, he whose home is strength, inspirer of the hymn, set over all the world;Brandishing here and there his lightly. moving goad, beholding every creature, Pūṣan, God, goes forth. O Pūṣan, with thy golden ships that travel across the ocean, in the air's mid-region,Thou goest on an embassy to Sūrya, subdued by love, desirous of the glory. Near kinsman of the heaven and earth is Pūṣan, liberal, Lord of food, of wondrous iustre,Whom strong and vigorous and swiftlymoving, subdued by love, the Deities gave to Sūrya.
