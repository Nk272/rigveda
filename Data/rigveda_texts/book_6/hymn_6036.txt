==================================================

. THY raptures ever were for all men's profit: so evermore have been thine earthly riches.Thou still hast been the dealer-forth of vigour, since among Gods thou hast had power and Godhead. Men have obtained his strength by sacrificing, and ever urged him, on to hero valour.For the rein-seizing, the impetuous Charger they furnished power even for Vá¹›tra's slaughter. Associate with him, as teams of horses, help, manly might, and vigour follow Indra.As rivers reach the sea, so, strong with praises, our holy songs reach him the Comprehensive. Lauded by us, let flow the spring, O Indra, of excellent and brightly-shining riches.For thou art Lord of men, without an equal: of all the world thou art the only Sovran. Hear what thou mayst hear, thou who, fain for worship, as heaven girds earth, guardest thy servant's treasure;Tlat thou mayst be our own, joying in power, famed through thy might in every generation.
