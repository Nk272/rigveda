==================================================

. TRUE, guardian of the Law, thy faithful servant wins ample light and dwells in peace, O Agni,Whom thou, as Varuṇa in accord with Mitra, guardest, O God, by banishing his trouble. He hath paid sacrifices, toiled in worship, and offered gifts to wealth-increasing Agni.Him the displeasure of the famous moves not, outrage and scorn affect not such a mortal. Bright God, whose look is free from stain like Sūrya's, thou, swift, what time thou earnestly desirest,Hast gear to give us. Come with joy at evening, where, Child of Wood, thou mayest also tarry. Fierce is his gait and vast his wondrous body: he champeth like a horse with bit and bridle,And, darting forth his tongue, as ’twere a hatchet, burning the woods, smelteth them like a smelter. Archer-like, fain toshoot, he sets his arrow, and whets his splendour like the edge of iron:The messenger of night with brilliant pathway, like a tree-roosting bird of rapid pinion. In beams of morn he clothes him like the singer, and bright as Mitra with his splendour crackles.Red in the night, by day the men's possession: red, he belongs to men by day, Immortal. Like Heaven's when scattering beams his voice was uttered: among the plants the radiant Hero shouted,Who with his glow in rapid course came hither to fill both worlds, well-wedded Dames, with treasure. Who, with supporting streams and rays that suit him, hath flashed like lightning with his native vigour.Like the deft Maker of the band of Maruts, the bright impetuous One hath shone refulgent.
