==================================================

. GREAT is this might of yours, Indra and Soma: the first high exploits were your own achievements.Ye found the Sun ye found the light of heaven: ye killed all darkness and the Gods’ blasphemers. Ye, Indra-Soma, gave her light to Morning, and led the Sun on high with all his splendour.Ye stayed the heaven with a supporting pillar, and spread abroad apart, the Earth, the Mother. Ye slew the flood -obstructing serpent Vṛtra, Indra and Soma: Heaven approved your exploit.Ye urged to speed the currents of the rivers, and many seas have ye filled full with waters. Ye in the unripe udders of the milch-kine have set the ripe milk, Indra, thou, and Soma.Ye have held fast the unimpeded whiteness within these many-coloured moving creatures. Verily ye bestow, Indra and Soma, wealth, famed, victorious, passing to our children.Ye have invested men, ye Mighty Beings, with manly strength that conquers in the battle.
