==================================================

 O WORTHY of oblation, Lord of prospering powers, assume thy robes,And offer this our sacrifice. Sit ever to be chosen, as our Priest, most youthful, through our hymns,O Agni, through our heavenly word. For here a Father for his son, Kinsman for kinsman worshippeth,And Friend, choice-worthy, for his friend. Here let the foe-destroyers sit, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,Like men, upon our sacred grass. O ancient Herald, be thou glad in this our rite and fellowship:Hearken thou well to these our songs. Whate’er in this perpetual course we sacrifice to God and God,That gift is offered up in thee May he be our dear household Lord, Priest, pleasant and, choice-worthy mayWe, with bright fires, be dear to him. The Gods, adored with brilliant fires. have granted precious wealth to usSo, with bright fires, we pray to thee. And, O Immortal One, so may the eulogies of mortal menBelong to us and thee alike. With all thy fires, O Agni, find pleasure in this our sacrifice,And this our speech, O Son of Strength.
