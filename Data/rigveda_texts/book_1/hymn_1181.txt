==================================================

. WHAT, dearest Pair, is this in strength and riches that ye as Priests are bring from the waters?This sacrifice is your glorification, ye who protect mankind and give them treasures. May your pure steeds, rain-drinkers, bring you hither, swift as the tempest, your celestial coursers,Rapid as thought, with fair backs, full of vigour, resplendent in their native light, O Aśvins. Your car is like a torrent rushing downward: may it come nigh, broad-seated, for our welfare,—Car holy, strong, that ever would be foremost, thought-swift, which ye, for whom we long, have mounted. Here sprung to life, they both have sung together, with bodies free from stain, with signs that mark them;One of you Prince of Sacrifice, the Victor, the other counts as Heaven's auspicious offspring. May your car-seat, down-gliding, golden-coloured, according to your wish approach our dwellings.Men shall feed full the bay steeds of the other, and, Aśvins they with roars shall stir the regions. Forth comes your strong Bull like a cloud of autumn, sending abundant food of liquid sweetness.Let them feed with the other's ways and vigour: the upper streams have come and do us service. Your constant song hath been sent forth, Disposers! that flows threefold in mighty strength, O Aśvins.Thus lauded, give the suppliant protection moving or resting hear mine invocation. This song of bright contents for you is swelling in the men's hall where three-fold grass is ready.Your strong rain-cloud, ye Mighty Ones, hath swollen, honouring men as ’twere with milk's outpouring. The prudent worshipper, like Pūṣan, Aśvins! praises you as he praises Dawn and Agni,When, singing with devotion, he invokes you. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.
