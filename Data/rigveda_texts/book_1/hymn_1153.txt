==================================================

. WE worship with our reverence and oblations you, Mitra Varuṇa, accordant, mighty,So that with us, ye Twain whose backs are sprinkled with oil, the priests with oil and hymns support you. Your praise is like a mighty power, an impulse: to you, Twain Gods, a well-formed hymn is offered,As the priest decks yon, Strong Ones, in assemblies, and the prince fain to worship you for blessings. O Mitra-Varuṇa, Aditi the Milch-cow streams for the rite, for folk who bring oblation,When in the assembly he who worships moves you, like to a human priest, with gifts presented. So may the kine and heavenly Waters pour you sweet drink in families that make you joyful.Of this may he, the ancient House-Lord, give us. Enjoy, drink of the milk the cow provideth.
