==================================================

. WINNER of thousands, kindled, thou shinest a God with Gods to-day.Bear out oblations, envoy, Sage. Child of Thyself the sacrifice is for the righteous blent with meath,Presenting viands thousandfold. Invoked and worthy of our praise bring Gods whose due is sacrifice:Thou, Agni, givest countless gifts. To seat a thousand Heroes they eastward have strewn the grass with might,Whereon, Ādityas, ye shine forth. The sovran all-imperial Doors, wide, good, many and manifold,Have poured their streams of holy oil. With gay adornment, fair to see, in glorious beauty shine they forth:Let Night and Morning rest them here. Let these two Sages first of all, heralds divine and eloquent,Perform for us this sacrifice. You I address, Sarasvatī, and Bhāratī, and Iḷā, all:Urge ye us on to glorious fame. Tvaṣṭar the Lord hath made all forms and all the cattle of the fieldCause them to multiply for us. Send to the Gods, Vanaspati, thyself, the sacrificial draught:Let Agni make the oblations sweet. Agni, preceder of the Gods, is honoured with the sacred song:He glows at offerings blest with Hail!
