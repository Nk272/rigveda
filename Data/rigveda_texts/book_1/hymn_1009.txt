==================================================

 COME, Indra, and delight thee with the juice at all the Soma feasts,Protector, mighty in thy strength. To Indra pour ye forth the juice, the active gladdening juice to himThe gladdening, omnific God. O Lord of all men, fair of cheek, rejoice thee in the gladdening lauds,Present at these drink-offerings. Songs have outpoured themselves to thee, Indra, the strong, the guardian Lord,And raised themselves unsatisfied. Send to us bounty manifold, O Indra, worthy of our wish,For power supreme is only thine. O Indra, stimulate thereto us emulously fain for wealth,And glorious, O most splendid One. Give, Indra, wide and lofty fame, wealthy in cattle and in strength,Lasting our life-time, failing not. Grant us high fame, O Indra, grant riches bestowing thousands, thoseFair fruits of earth borne home in wains. Praising with songs the praise-worthy who cometh to our aid, we callIndra, the Treasure-Lord of wealth. To lofty Indra, dweller by each libation, the pious manSings forth aloud a strengthening hymn.
