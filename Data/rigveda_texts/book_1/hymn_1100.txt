==================================================

. MAY he who hath his home with strength, the Mighty, the King supreme of earth and spacious heaven,Lord of true power, to he invoked in battles,—may Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. Whose way is unattainable like Sūrya's: he in each fight is the strong Vṛtra-slayer,Mightiest with his Friends in his own courses. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. Whose paths go forth in their great might resistless, forthmilking, as it were, heaven's genial moisture.With manly strength triumphant, foe-subduer,—may Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. Among Aṅgirases he was the chiefest, a Friend with friends, mighty amid the mighty.Praiser mid praisers, honoured most of singers. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. Strong with the Rudras as with his own children, in manly battle conquering his foemen 'With his close comrades doing deeds of glory,—may Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. Humbler of pride, exciter of the conflict, the Lord of heroes, God invoked of many,May he this day gain with our men the sunlight. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. His help hath made him cheerer in the battle, the folk have made him guardian of their comfort.Sole Lord is he of every holy service. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. To him the Hero, on high days of prowess, heroes for help and booty shall betake them.He hath found light even in the blinding darkness. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. He with his left hand checketh even the mighty, and with his right hand gathereth up the booty.Even with the humble he acquireth riches. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. With hosts on foot and cars he winneth treasures: well is he known this day by all the people.With manly might he conquereth those who hate him. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. When in his ways with kinsmen or with strangers he speedeth to the fight, invoked of many,For gain of waters, and of sons and grandsons, may Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. Awful and fierce, fiend-slayer, thunder-wielder, with boundless knowledge, hymned by hundreds, mighty,In strength like Soma, guard of the Five Peoples, may Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. Winning the light, hitherward roars his thunder like the terrific mighty voice of Heaven.Rich gifts and treasures evermore attend him. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. Whose home eternal through his strength surrounds him on every side, his laud, the earth and heaven,May he, delighted with our service, save us. May Indra, girt by Maruts, be our succour. The limit of whose power not Gods by Godhead, nor mortal men have reached, nor yet the Waters.Both Earth and Heaven in vigour he surpasseth. May Indra, girt by Maruts, he our succour. The red and tawny mare, blaze-marked, high standing, celestial who, to bring Ṛjrāśva riches,Drew at the pole the chariot yoked with stallions, joyous, among the hosts of men was noted. The Vārṣāgiras unto thee, O Indra, the Mighty One, sing forth this laud to please thee,Ṛjrāśva with his fellows, Ambarīṣa, Surādhas, Sahadeva, Bhayamāna. He, much invoked, hath slain Dasyus and Śimyus, after his wont, and laid them low with arrows.The mighty Thunderer with his fair-complexioned friends won the land, the sunlight, and the waters. May Indra evermore be our protector, and unimperilled may we win the booty.This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.
