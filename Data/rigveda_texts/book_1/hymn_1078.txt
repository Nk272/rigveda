==================================================

. O JĀTAVEDAS, keen and swift, we Gotamas with sacred song exalt thee for thy glories' sake. Thee, as thou art, desiring wealth Gotama worships with his song:We laud thee for thy glories' sake. As such, like Aṅgiras we call on thee best winner of the spoil:We laud thee for thy glories' sake. Thee, best of Vṛtra-slayers, thee who shakest off our Dasyu foes:We laud thee for thy glories' sake. A pleasant song to Agni we, sons of Rahūgaṅa, have sung:We laud thee for thy glories' sake.
