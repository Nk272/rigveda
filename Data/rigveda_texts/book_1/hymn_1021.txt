==================================================

 INDRA and Agni I invoke fain are we for their song of praise:Chief Soma-drinkers are they both. Praise ye, O men, and glorify Indra-Agni in the holy rites:Sing praise to them in sacred songs. Indra and Agni we invite, the Soma-drinkers, for the fameOf Mitra, to the Soma-draught. Strong Gods, we bid them come to this libation that stands ready here:Indra and Agni, come to us. Indra and Agni, mighty Lords of our assembly, crush the fiends:Childless be the devouring ones. Watch ye, through this your truthfulness, there in the place of spacious viewIndra and Agni, send us bliss.
