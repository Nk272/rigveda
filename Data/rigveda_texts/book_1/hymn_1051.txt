==================================================

 MAKE glad with songs that Ram whom many men invoke, worthy of songs of praise, Indra, the sea of wealth;Whose gracious deeds for men spread like the heavens abroad: sing praise to him the Sage, most liberal for our good. As aids the skilful Ṛbhus yearned to Indra strong to save, who fills mid-air, encompassed round with might,Rushing in rapture; and o’er Śatakratu came the gladdening shout that urged him on to victory. Thou hast disclosed the kine's stall for the Aṅgirases, and made a way for Atri by a hundred doors.On Vimada thou hast bestowed both food and wealth, making thy bolt dance in the sacrificer's fight. Thou hast unclosed the prisons of the waters; thou hast in the mountain seized the treasure rich in gifts.When thou hadst slain with might the dragon Vṛtra, thou, Indra, didst raise the Sun in heaven for all to see. With wondrous might thou blewest enchanter fiends away, with powers celestial those who called on thee in jest.Thou, hero-hearted, hast broken down Pipru's forts, and helped Ṛjiśvan when the Dasyus were struck dead. Thou savedst Kutsa when Śuṣṇa was smitten down; to Atithigva gavest Śambara for a prey.E’en mighty Arbuda thou troddest under foot: thou from of old wast born to strike the Dasyus dead. All power and might is closely gathered up in thee; thy bounteous spirit joys in drinking Soma juice.Known is the thunderbolt that lies within thine arms: rend off therewith all manly prowess of our foe. Discern thou well Āryas and Dasyus; punishing the lawless give them up to him whose grass is strewn.Be thou the sacrificer's strong encourager all these thy deeds are my delight at festivals. Indra gives up the lawless to the pious man, destroying by the Strong Ones those who have no strength.Vamra when glorified destroyed the gathered piles of the still waxing great one who would reach the heaven. The might which Uśanā hath formed for thee with might rends in its greatness and with strength both worlds apart.O Hero-souled, the steeds of Vāta, yoked by thought, have carried thee to fame while thou art filled with power. When Indra hath rejoiced with Kāvya Uśanā, he mounts his steeds who swerve wider and wider yet.The Strong hath loosed his bolt with the swift rush of rain, and he hath rent in pieces Śuṣṇa's firm-built forts. Thou mountest on thy car amid strong Soma draughts: Śāryāta brought thee those in which thou hast delight.Indra, when thou art pleased with men whose Soma flows thou risest to unchallenged glory in the sky. To old Kakṣīvān, Soma-presser, skilled in song, O Indra, thou didst give the youthful Vṛcayā.Thou, very wise, wast Menā, Vrsanśva's child: those deeds of thine must all be told at Soma feasts. The good man's refuge in his need is Indra, firm as a doorpost, praised among the Pajras.Indra alone is Lord of wealth, the Giver, lover of riches, chariots, kine, and horses. To him the Mighty One, the self-resplendent, verily strong and great, this praise is uttered.May we and all the heroes, with the princes, be, in this fray, O Indra, in thy keeping.
