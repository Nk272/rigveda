==================================================

 I CRAVE help from the Imperial Lords, from Indra-Varuṇa; may theyBoth favour one of us like me. Guardians of men, ye ever come with ready succour at the callOf every singer such as I. Sate you, according to your wish, O Indra-Varuṇa, with wealth:Fain would we have you nearest us. May we be sharers of the powers, sharers of the benevolenceOf you who give strength bounteously. Indra and Varuṇa, among givers of thousands, meet for praise,Are Powers who merit highest laud. Through their protection may we gain great store of wealth, and heap it upEnough and still to spare, be ours. O Indra-Varuṇa, on you for wealth in many a form I call:Still keep ye us victorious. O Indra-Varuṇa, through our songs that seek to win you to ourselves,Give us at once your sheltering help. O Indra-Varuṇa, to you may fair praise which I offer come,Joint eulogy which ye dignify.
