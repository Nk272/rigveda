==================================================

. WITH stones have we pressed out: O come; these gladdening drops are blent with milk, these Soma-drops which gladden you.Come to us, Kings who reach to heaven, approach us, coming hitherward.These milky drops are yours, Mitra and Varuṇa, bright Soma juices blent with milk. Here are the droppings; come ye nigh the Soma-droppings blent with curd, juices expressed and blent with curd.Now for the wakening of your Dawn together with the Sun-God's rays,juice waits for Mitra and for Varuṇa to drink, fair juice for drink, for sacrifice. As ’twere a radiant-coloured cow, they milk with stones the stalk for you, with stones they milk the Soma-plant.May ye come nigh us, may ye turn hither to drink the Soma juice.The men pressed out this juice, Mitra and Varuṇa, pressed out this Soma for your drink.
