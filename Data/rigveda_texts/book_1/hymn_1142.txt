==================================================

. KINDLED, bring, Agni, Gods to-day for him who lifts the ladle up.Spin out the ancient thread for him who sheds, with gifts, the Soma juice. Thou dealest forth, Tanūnapāt, sweet sacrifice enriched with oil,Brought by a singer such as I who offers gifts and toils for thee. He wondrous, sanctifying, bright, sprinkles the sacrifice with mead,Thrice, Narāśaṁsa from the heavens, a God mid Gods adorable. Agni, besought, bring hitherward Indra the Friend, the Wonderful,For this my hymn of praise, O sweet of tongue, is chanted forth to thee. The ladle-holders strew trimmed grass at this well-ordered sacrifice;A home for Indra is adorned, wide, fittest to receive the Gods. Thrown open be the Doors Divine, unfailing, that assist the rite,High, purifying, much-desired, so that the Gods may enter in. May Night and Morning, hymned with lauds, united, fair to look upon,Strong Mothers of the sacrifice, seat them together on the grass. May the two Priests Divine, the sage, the sweet-voiced lovers of the hymn,Complete this sacrifice of ours, effectual, reaching heaven to-day. Let Hotrā pure, set among Gods, amid the Maruts Bhāratī, Iḷā, Sarasvatī, Mahī, rest on the grass, adorable. May Tvaṣṭar send us genial dew abundant, wondrous, rich in gifts,For increase and for growth of wealth, Tvaṣṭar our kinsman and our Friend. Vanaspati, give forth, thyself, and call the Gods to sacrifice.May Agni, God intelligent, speed our oblation to the Gods. To Vāyu joined with Pūṣan, with the Maruts, and the host of Gods,To Indra who inspires the hymn cry Glory! and present the gift. Come hither to enjoy the gifts prepared with cry of Glory! Come,O Indra, hear their calling; they invite thee to the sacrifice.
