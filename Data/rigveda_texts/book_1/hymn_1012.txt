==================================================

 WE choose Agni the messenger, the herald, master of all wealth,Well skilled in this our sacrifice. With callings ever they invoke Agni, Agni, Lord of the House,Oblation-bearer, much beloved. Bring the Gods hither, Agni, born for him who strews the sacred grass:Thou art our herald, meet for praise. Wake up the willing Gods, since thou, Agni, performest embassage:Sit on the sacred grass with Gods. O Agni, radiant One, to whom the holy oil is poured, burn upOur enemies whom fiends protect. By AgniÂ Agni is inflamed, Lord of the House, wise, young, who bearsThe gift: the ladle is his mouth. Praise Agni in the sacrifice, the Sage whose ways are ever true,The God who driveth grief away. God, Agni, be his strong defence who lord of sacrificial gifts,Worshippeth thee the messenger. Whoso with sacred gift would fain call Agni to the feast of Gods,O Purifier, favour him. Such, Agni, Purifier, bright, bring hither to our sacrifice,To our oblation bring the Gods. So lauded by our newest song of praise bring opulence to us,And food, with heroes for our sons. O Agni, by effulgent flame, by all invokings of the Gods,Show pleasure in this laud of ours.
