==================================================

. HE in mid-air's expanse hath golden tresses; a raging serpent, like the rushing tempest:Purely refulgent, knowing well the morning; like honourable dames, true, active workers. Thy well-winged flashes strengthen in their manner, when the black Bull hath bellowed round about us.With drops that bless and seem to smile he cometh: the waters fall, the clouds utter their thunder. When he comes streaming with the milk of worship, conducting by directest paths of OrderAryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa, Parijman fill the hide full where lies the nether press-stone. O Agni, thou who art the lord of wealth in kine, thou Son of Strength,Vouchsafe to us, O Jātavedas, high renown. He, Agni, kindled, good and wise, must be exalted in our song:Shine, thou of many forms, shine radiantly on us. O Agni, shining of thyself by night and when the morning breaks,Burn, thou whose teeth are sharp, against the Rākṣasas. Adorable in all our rites, favour us, Agni, with thine aid,When the great hymn is chanted forth. Bring to us ever-conquering wealth, wealth, Agni, worthy of our choice,In all our frays invincible. Give us, O Agni, through thy grace wealth that supporteth all our life,Thy favour so that we may live. O Gotama, desiring bliss present thy songs composed with careTo Agni of the pointed flames. May the man fall, O Agni, who near or afar assaileth us:Do thou increase and prosper us. Keen and swift Agni, thousand-eyed, chaseth the Rākṣasas afar:He singeth, herald meet for lauds.
