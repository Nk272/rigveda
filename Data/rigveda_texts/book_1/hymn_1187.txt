==================================================

. Now will I glorify Food that upholds great strength,By whose invigorating power Trita rent Vṛtra limb from limb. O pleasant Food, O Food of meath, thee have we chosen for our own,So be our kind protector thou. Come hitherward to us, O Food, auspicious with auspicious help,Health-bringing, not unkind, a dear and guileless friend. These juices which, O Food, are thine throughout the regions are diffused.like winds they have their place in heaven. These gifts of thine, O Food, O Food most sweet to taste,These savours of thy juices work like creatures that have mighty necks. In thee, O Food, is set the spirit of great Gods.Under thy flag brave deeds were done he slew the Dragon with thy help. If thou be gone unto the splendour of the clouds,Even from thence, O Food of meath, prepared for our enjoyment, come. Whatever morsel we consume from waters or from plants of earth, O Soma, wax thou fat thereby. What Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vātāpi, grow thou fat thereby. O Vegetable, Cake of meal, he wholesome, firm, and strengthening: Vātāpi, grow thou fat thereby. O Food, from thee as such have we drawn forth with lauds, like cows, our sacrificial gifts,From thee who banquetest with Gods, from thee who banquetest with us.
