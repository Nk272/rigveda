==================================================

 To this fair sacrifice to drink the milky draught thou art invoked:O Agni, with the Maruts come. No mortal man, no God exceeds thy mental power, O Mighty one:O Agni, with the Maruts come: All Gods devoid of guile, who know the mighty region of mid-air:O Agni, with those Maruts come. The terrible, who sing their song, not to be overcome by might:O Agni, with those Maruts come. Brilliant, and awful in their form, mighty, devourers of their foes:O Agni, with those Maruts come. Who sit as Deities in heaven, above the sky-vault's luminous sphere:O Agni, with those Maruts come. Who scatter clouds about the sky, away over the billowy sea:O Agni, with those Maruts come. Who with their bright beams spread them forth over the ocean in their mightO Agni, with those Maruts come. For thee, to be thine early draught, I pour the Soma-mingled meath:O Agni, with the Maruts come.
