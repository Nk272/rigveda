==================================================

 NE’ER waxeth faint the Immortal, Son of Strength, since he, the Herald, hath become Vivasvān's messenger.On paths most excellent he measured out mid-air: he with oblation calls to service of the Gods. Never decaying, seizing his appropriate food, rapidly, eagerly through the dry wood he spreads.His back, as he is sprinkled, glistens like a horse: loud hath he roared and shouted like the heights of heaven? Set high in place o’er all that Vasus, Rudras do, immortal, Lord of riches, seated as High Priest;Hastening like a car to men, to those who live, the God without delay gives boons to be desired. Urged by the wind be spreads through dry wood as he lists, armed with his tongues for sickles, with a mighty roar.Black is thy path, Agni, changeless, with glittering waves! when like a bull thou rushest eager to the trees. With teeth of flame, wind-driven, through the wood he speeds, triumphant like a bull among the herd of cows,With bright strength roaming to the everlasting air: things fixed, things moving quake before him as he flies. The Bhṛgus established thee among mankind for men, like as a treasure, beauteous, easy to invoke;Thee, Agni, as a herald and choice-worthy guest, as an auspicious Friend to the Celestial Race. Agni, the seven tongues' deftest Sacrificer, him whom the priests elect at solemn worship,The Herald, messenger of all the Vasus, I serve with dainty food, I ask for riches. Grant, Son of Strength, thou rich in friends, a refuge without a flaw this day to us thy praisers.O Agni, Son of Strength, with forts of iron preserve thou from distress the man who lauds thee. Be thou a refuge, Bright One, to the singer, a shelter, Bounteous Lord, to those who worship.Preserve the singer from distress, O Agni. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.
