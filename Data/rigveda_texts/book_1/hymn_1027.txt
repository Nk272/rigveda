==================================================

 WITH worship will I glorify thee, Agni, like a long-tailed steed,Imperial Lord of sacred rites. May the far-striding Son of Strength, bringer of great felicity,Who pours his gifts like rain, be ours. Lord of all life, from near; from far, do thou, O Agni evermoreProtect us from the sinful man. O Agni, graciously announce this our oblation to the Gods,And this our newest song of praise. Give us a share of strength most high, a share of strength that is below,A share of strength that is between. Thou dealest gifts, resplendent One; nigh, as with waves of Sindhu, thouSwift streamest to the worshipper. That man is lord of endless strength whom thou protectest in the fight,Agni, or urgest to the fray. Him, whosoever he may be, no man may vanquish, mighty One:Nay, very glorious power is his. May he who dwells with all mankind bear us with war-steeds through the fight,And with the singers win the spoil. Help, thou who knowest lauds, this work, this eulogy to Rudra, himAdorable in every house. May this our God, great, limitless, smoke-bannered excellently bright,Urge us to strength and holy thought. Like some rich Lord of men may he, Agni the banner of the Gods,Refulgent, hear us through our lauds. Glory to Gods, the mighty and the lesser glory to Gods the younger and the elder!Let us, if we have power, pay the God worship: no better prayer than this, ye Gods, acknowledge.
