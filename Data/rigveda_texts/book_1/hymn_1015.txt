==================================================

 O INDRA drink the Soma juice with Ṛtu; let the cheering dropsSink deep within, which settle there. Drink from the Purifier's cup, Maruts, with Ṛtu; sanctifyThe rite, for ye give precious gifts. O Neṣṭar, with thy Dame accept our sacrifice; with Ṛtu drink,For thou art he who giveth wealth. Bring the Gods, Agni; in the three appointed places set them down:Surround them, and with Ṛtu drink. Drink Soma after the Ṛtus, from the Brāhmaṇa's bounty: undissolved,O Indra, is thy friendship's bond. Mitra, Varuṇa, ye whose ways are firm—a Power that none deceives—,With Ṛtu ye have reached the rite. The Soma-pressers, fain for wealth, praise the Wealth-giver in the rite,In sacrifices praise the God. May the Wealth-giver grant to us riches that shall be far renowned.These things we gain, among the Gods. He with the Ṛtu fain would drink, Wealth-giver, from the Neṣṭar's bowl.Haste, give your offering, and depart. As we this fourth time, Wealth-giver, honour thee with the Ṛtus, beA Giver bountiful to us. Drink ye the meath, O Aśvins bright with flames, whose acts are pure, who withṚtus accept the sacrifice. With Ṛtu, through the house-fire, thou, kind Giver, guidest sacrifice:Worship the Gods for the pious man.
