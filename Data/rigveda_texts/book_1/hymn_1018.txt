==================================================

 O BRĀHMAṆASPATI, make him who presses Soma glorious,Even Kakṣīvān Auśija. The rich, the healer of disease, who giveth wealth, increaseth store,The prompt,—may he be with us still. Let not the foeman's curse, let not a mortal's onslaught fall on usPreserve us, Brahmaṇaspati. Ne’er is the mortal hero harmed whom Indra, Brahmaṇaspati,And Soma graciously inspire. Do, thou, O Brahmaṇaspati, and Indra, Soma, Dakṣiṇā,Preserve that mortal from distress. To the Assembly's wondrous Lord, to Indra's lovely Friend who givesWisdom, have I drawn near in prayer. He without whom no sacrifice, e’en of the wise man, prospers; heStirs up the series of thoughts. He makes the oblation prosper, he promotes the course of sacrifice:Our voice of praise goes to the Gods. I have seen Narāśaṁsa, him most resolute, most widely famed,As ’twere the Household Priest of heaven.
