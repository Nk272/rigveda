==================================================

. LONGING for weal I looked around, in spirit, for kinsmen, Indra-Agni, or for brothers.No providence but yours alone is with me so have I wrought for you this hymn for succour. For I have heard that ye give wealth more freely than worthless son-in-law or spouse's brother.So offering to you this draught of Soma, I make you this new hymn, Indra and Agni, Let us not break the cords: with this petition we strive to gain the powers of our forefathers.For Indra-Agni the strong drops are joyful, for here in the bowl's lap are both the press-stones. For you the bowl divine, Indra and Agni, presses the Soma gladly to delight you.With hands auspicious and fair arms, ye Aśvins, haste, sprinkle it with sweetness in the waters. You, I have heard, were mightiest, Indra-Agni, when Vṛtra fell and when the spoil was parted.Sit at this sacrifice, ye ever active, on the strewn grass, and with the juice delight you. Surpassing all men where they shout for battle, ye Twain exceed the earth and heaven in greatness.Greater are ye than rivers and than mountains, O Indra-Agni, and all things beside them. Bring wealth and give it, ye whose arms wield thunder: Indra and Agni, with your powers protect us.Now of a truth these be the very sunbeams wherewith our fathers were of old united. Give, ye who shatter forts, whose hands wield thunder: Indra and Agni, save us in our battles.This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.
