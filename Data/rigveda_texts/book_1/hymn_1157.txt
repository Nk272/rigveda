==================================================

. AGNI is wakened: Sūrya riseth from the earth. Mighty, refulgent Dawn hath shone with all her light.The Aśvins have equipped their chariot for the course. God Savitar hath moved the folk in sundry ways. When, Aśvins, ye equip your very mighty car, bedew, ye Twain, our power with honey and with oil.To our devotion give victorious strength in war: may we win riches in the heroes' strife for spoil. Nigh to us come the Aśvins' lauded three-wheeled car, the car laden with meath and drawn by fleet-foot steeds,Three-seated, opulent, bestowing all delight. may it bring weal to us, to cattle and to men. Bring hither nourishment for us, ye Aśvins Twain; sprinkle us with your whip that drops with honey-dew.Prolong our days of life, wipe out our trespasses; destroy our foes, be our companions and our Friends. Ye store the germ of life in female creatures, ye lay it up within all living beings.Ye have sent forth, O Aśvins passing mighty, the fire, the sovrans of the wood, the waters, Leeches are ye with medicines to heal us, and charioteers are ye with skill in driving.Ye Strong, give sway to him who brings oblation and with his heart pours out his gift before you.
