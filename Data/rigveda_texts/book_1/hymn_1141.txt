==================================================

. YEA, verily, the fair effulgence of the God for glory was established, since he sprang from strength.When he inclines thereto successful is the hymn: the songs of sacrifice have brought him as they flow Wonderful, rich in nourishment, he dwells in food; next, in the seven auspicious Mothers is his home.Thirdly, that they might drain the treasures of the Bull, the maidens brought forth him for whom the ten provide. What time from out the deep, from the Steer's wondrous form, the Chiefs who had the power produced him with their strength;When Mātariśvan rubbed forth him who lay concealed, for mixture of the sweet drink, in the days of old. When from the Highest Father he is brought to us, amid the plants he rises hungry, wondrously.As both together join to expedite his birth, most youthful he is born resplendent in his light. Then also entered he the Mothers, and in them pure and uninjured he increased in magnitude.As to the first he rose, the vigorous from of old, so now he runs among the younger lowest ones. Therefore they choose him Herald at the morning rites, pressing to him as unto Bhaga, pouring gifts,When, much-praised, by the power and will of Gods, he goes at all times to his mortal worshipper to drink. What time the Holy One, wind-urged, hath risen up, serpent-like winding through the dry grass unrestrained,Dust lies upon the way of him who burneth all, black-winged and pure of birth who follows sundry paths. Like a swift chariot made by men who know their art, he with his red limbs lifts himself aloft to heaven.Thy worshippers become by burning black of hue: their strength flies as before a hero's violence. By thee, O Agni, Varuṇa who guards the Law, Mitra and Aryaman, the Bounteous, are made strong;For, as the felly holds the spokes, thou with thy might pervading hast been born encompassing them round. Agni, to him who toils and pours libations, thou, Most Youthful! sendest wealth and all the host of Gods.Thee, therefore, even as Bhaga, will we set anew, young Child of Strength, most wealthy! in our battle-song. Vouchsafe us riches turned to worthy ends, good luck abiding in the house, and strong capacity,Wealth that directs both worlds as they were guiding-reins, and, very Wise, the Gods’ assent in sacrifice. May he, the Priest resplendent, joyful, hear us, he with the radiant car and rapid horses.May Agni, ever wise, with best directions to bliss and highest happiness conduct us. With hymns of might hath Agni now been lauded, advanced to height of universal kingship.Now may these wealthy chiefs and we together spread forth as spreads the Sun above the rain-clouds.
