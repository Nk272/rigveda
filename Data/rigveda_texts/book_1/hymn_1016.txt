 LET thy Bay Steeds bring thee, the Strong, hither to drink the Soma draught—Those, Indra, who are bright as suns. Here are the grains bedewed with oil: hither let the Bay Coursers bringIndra upon his easiest car. Indra at early morn we call, Indra in course of sacrifice,Indra to drink the Soma juice. Come hither, with thy long-maned Steeds, O Indra, to he draught we pourWe call thee when the juice is shed. Come thou to this our song of praise, to the libation poured for theeDrink of it like a stag athirst. Here are the drops of Soma juice expressed on sacred grass: thereofDrink, Indra, to increase thy might. Welcome to thee be this our hymn, reaching thy heart, most excellent:Then drink the Soma juice expressed. To every draught of pressed-out juice Indra, the Vṛtra-slayer, comes,To drink the Soma for delight. Fulfil, O Śatakratu, all our wish with horses and with kine:With holy thoughts we sing thy praise.
