==================================================

 E'EN from above the sky's bright realm come, Uṣas, by auspicious ways:Let red steeds bear thee to the house of him who pours the Soma, juice. The chariot which thou mountest, fair of shape, O Uṣas light to move,—Therewith, O Daughter of the Sky, aid men of noble fame today. Bright Uṣas, when thy times return, all quadrupeds and bipeds stir,And round about flock winged birds from all the boundaries of heaven. Thou dawning with thy beams of light illumest all the radiant realm.Thee, as thou art, the Kaṇvas, fain for wealth, have called with sacred songs.
