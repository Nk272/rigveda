==================================================

. STILL in Vaiśvānara's grace may we continue: yea, he is King supreme o’er all things living.Sprung hence to life upon this All he looketh. Vaiśvānara hath rivalry with Sūrya. Present in heaven, in earth, all-present Agni,—all plants that grow on ground hath he pervaded.May Agni, may Vaiśvānara with vigour, present, preserve us day and night from foemen. Be this thy truth, Vaiśvānara, to us-ward: let wealth in rich abundance gather round us.This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.
