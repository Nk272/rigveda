==================================================

. WELL knowing I have bound me, horselike, to the pole: I carry that which bears as on and gives us help.I seek for no release, no turning back therefrom. May he who knows the way, the Leader, guide me straight. O Agni, Indra, Varuṇa, and Mitra, give, O ye Gods, and Marut host, and Viṣṇu.May both Nāsatyas, Rudra, heavenly Matrons, Pūṣan, Sarasvatī, Bhaga, accept us. Indra and Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa, Aditi, the Waters, Mountains, Maruts, Sky, and Earth and Heaven,Viṣṇu I call, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, and Bhaga, Samsa, Savitar that they may help. May Viṣṇu also and Vāta who injures none, and Soma granter of possessions give us joy;And may the Ṛbhus and the Aśvins, Tvaṣṭar and Vibhvan remember us so that we may have wealth. So may the band of Maruts dwelling in the sky, the holy, come to us to sit on sacred grass;Bṛhaspati and Pūṣan grant us sure defence, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman guard and shelter us. And may the Mountains famed in noble eulogies, and the fair-gleaming Rivers keep us safe from harm.May Bhaga the Dispenser come with power and grace, and far-pervading Aditi listen to my call. May the Gods’ Spouses aid us of their own freewill, aid us to offspring and the winning of the spoil.Grant us protection, O ye gracious Goddesses, ye who are on the earth or in the waters' realm. May the Dames, wives of Gods, enjoy our presents, Rat, Aśvini, Agnāyī, and Indrāṇī.May Rodasī and Varuṇānī hear us, and Goddesses come at the Matrons' season.
