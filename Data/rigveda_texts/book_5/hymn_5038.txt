==================================================

. WIDE, Indra Śatakratu, spreads the bounty of thine ample grace:So, Lord of fair dominion, Friend of all men, give us splendid wealth. The food which, Mightiest Indra, thou possessest worthy of renownIs bruited as most widely famed, invincible, O Golden-hued! O Darter of the Stone, the powers which readily obey thy will,—Divinities, both thou and they, ye rule, to guard them, earth and heaven. And from whatever power of thine, O Vṛtra-slayer, it may be,Bring thou to us heroic strength: thou hast a man's regard for us. In thy protection, with these aids of thine, O Lord of Hundred Powers,Indra, may we be guarded well, Hero, may we be guarded well.
