==================================================

. To Agni, lofty Asura, meet for worship, Steer of eternal Law, my prayer I offer;I bring my song directed to the Mighty like pure oil for his mouth at sacrifices. Mark the Law, thou who knowest, yea, observe it: send forth the full streams of eternal Order.I use no sorcery with might or falsehood the sacred Law of the Red Steer I follow. How hast thou, follower of the Law eternal, become the knower of a new song, Agni?The God, the Guardian of the seasons, knows me: the Lord of him who won this wealth I know not. Who, Agni, in alliance with thy foeman, what splendid helpers won for them their riches?Agni, who guard the dwelling-place of falsehood? Who are protectors of the speech of liars? Agni, those friends of thine have turned them from thee: gracious of old, they have become ungracious.They have deceived themselves by their own speeches, uttering wicked words against the righteous. He who pays sacrifice to thee with homage, O Agni, keeps the Red Steer's Law eternal;Wide is his dwelling. May the noble offspring of Nahuá¹£a who wandered forth come hither.
