==================================================

. GREAT power is in the beam of light, sing praise to, Agni, to the GodWhom men have set in foremost place like Mitra with their eulogies. He by the splendour of his arms is Priest of every able man.Agni conveys oblation straight, and deals, as Bhaga deals, his boons. All rests upon the laud and love of him the rich, high-flaming God,On whom, loud-roaring, men have laid great strength as on a faithful friend. So, Agni, be the Friend of these with liberal gift of hero strength.Yea, Heaven and Earth have not surpassed this Youthful One in glorious fame. O Agni, quickly come to us, and, glorified, bring precious wealth.So we and these our princes will assemble for the good of all. Be near in fight to prosper us.
