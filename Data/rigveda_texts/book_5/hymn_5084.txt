==================================================

. THOU, of a truth,O Prthivi, bearest the tool that rends the hills:Thou rich in torrents, who with might quickenest earth, O Mighty One. To thee, O wanderer at will, ring out the lauds with beams of day,Who drivest, like a neighing steed, the swelling cloud, O bright of hue. Who graspest with thy might on earth. eâ€™en the strong sovrans of the wood,When from the lightning of thy cloud the rain-floods of the heaven descend.
