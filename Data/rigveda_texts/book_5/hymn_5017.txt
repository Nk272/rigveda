==================================================

. GOD, may a mortal call the Strong hither, with solemn rites, to aid,A man call Agni to protect when sacrifice is well prepared. Near him thou seemest mightier still in native glory, set to holdApart yon flame-hued vault of heaven, lovely beyond the thought of man. Yea, this is by the light of him whom powerful song hath bound to act,Whose beams of splendour flash on high as though they sprang from heavenly seed. Wealth loads the Wonder-Worker's car through his, the very wise One's power.Then, meet to be invoked among all tribes, is Agni glorified. Now, too, the princes shall obtain excellent riches by our lips.Protect us for our welfare: lend thy succour, O thou Son of Strength. Be near in fight to prosper us.
