==================================================

. By thy fair splendour's mighty power, O Agni, bring victorious wealth,Wealth that oâ€™ercometh all mankind, and, near us, conquereth in fight. Victorious Agni, bring to us the wealth that vanquisheth in war;For thou art wonderful and true, giver of strength in herds of kine. For all the folk with one accord, whose sacred grass is trimmed and strewn,Invite thee to their worship-halls, as a dear Priest, for choicest wealth. For he, the God of all men, hath gotten him might that quelleth foes.O Agni, in these homes shine forth, bright God! for our prosperity, shine, Purifier! splendidly.
