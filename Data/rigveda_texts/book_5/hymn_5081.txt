==================================================

. THE priests of him the lofty Priest well-skilled in hymns harness their spirit, yea, harness their holy thoughts.He only knowing works assigns their priestly tasks. Yea, lofty is the praise of Savitar the God. The Sapient One arrays himself in every form: for quadruped and biped he hath brought forth good.Excellent Savitar hath looked on heaven's high vault, and shineth after the outgoing of the Dawn. Even he, the God whose going-forth and majesty the other Deities have followed with their might,He who hath measured the terrestrial regions out by his great power, he is the Courser Savitar. To the three spheres of light thou goest, Savitar, and with the rays of Sidrya thou combinest thee.Around, on both sides thou encompassest the night: yea, thou, O God, art Mitra through thy righteous laws. Over all generation thou art Lord alone: Pūṣan art thou, O God, in all thy goings-forth.Yea, thou hast domination over all this world. Śyāvāśva hath brought praise to thee, O Savitar,
