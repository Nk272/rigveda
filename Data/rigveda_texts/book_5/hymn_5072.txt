==================================================

 To Varuṇa and Mitra we offer with songs, as Atri did. Sit on the sacred grass to drink the Soma juice. By Ordinance and Law ye dwell in peace secure, bestirring men.Sit on the sacred grass to drink the Soma juice. May Varuṇa and Mitra, for our help, accept the sacrifice.Sit on the sacred grass to drink the Soma juice.
