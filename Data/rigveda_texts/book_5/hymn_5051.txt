==================================================

. WITH all assistants, Agni, come hither to drink the Soma-juice;With Gods unto our sacred gifts. Come to the sacrifice, O ye whose ways are right, whose laws are true,And drink the draught with Agni's tongue. O Singer, with the singers, O Gracious, with those who move at dawn,Come to the Soma-draught with Gods. To Indra and to Vāyu dear, this Soma, by the mortar pressed,Is now poured forth to fill the jar. Vāyu, come hither to the feast, wellpleased unto our sacred gifts:Drink of the Soma juice effused come to the food. Ye, Indra, Vāyu, well deserve to drink the juices pressed by us.Gladly accept them, spotless Pair come to the food. For Indra and for Vāyu pressed are Soma juices blent with curd,As rivers to the lowland flow: come to the food. Associate with all the Gods, come, with the Aśvins and with Dawn,Agni, as erst with Atri, so enjoy the juice. Associate with Varuṇa, with Mitra, Soma, Viṣṇu, come,Agni, as erstwith Atri, so enjoy the juice. Associate with Vasus, with Ādityas, Indra, Viyu, come, Agni as erst with Atri, so enjoy the juice. May Bhaga and the Aśvins grant us health and wealth, and Goddess Adid and he whom none resist.The Asura Pūṣan grant us all prosperity, and Heaven and Earth most wise vouchsafe us happiness. Let us solicit Vāyu for prosperity, and Soma who is Lord of all the world for weal;For weal Bṛhaspati with all his company. May the Ādityas bring us health and happiness. May all the Gods, may Agni the beneficent, God of all men, this day be with us for our weal.Help us the Ṛbhus, the Divine Ones, for our good. May Rudra bless and keep us from calamity. Prosper us, Mitra, Varuṇa. O wealthy Pathya, prosper us.Indra and Agni, prosper us; prosper us thou, O Aditi. Like Sun and Moon may we pursue in full prosperity our path,And meet with one who gives again, -who knows us well and slays us not.
