==================================================

. MAY Indra come to us, he who knows rightly to give forth treasures from his store of riches.Even as a thirsty steer who roams the deserts may he drink eagerly the milked-out Soma. Lord of Bay Horses, Hero, may the Soma rise to thy cheeks and jaws like mountain-ridges.May we, O King, as he who driveth coursers, all joy in thee with hymns, invoked of many! Invoked of many, Caster of the Stone my heart quakes like a rolling wheel for fear of penury.Shall not Puruvasu the singer give thee praise, O ever-prospering Maghavan, mounted on thy car? Like the press-stone is this thy praiser, Indra. Loudly he lifts his voice with strong endeavour.With thy left hand, O Maghavan, give us riches: with thy right, Lord of Bays, be not reluctant. May the strong Heaven make thee the Strong wax stronger: Strong, thou art borne by thy two strong Bay Horses.So, fair of cheek, with mighty chariot, mighty, uphold us, strong-willed, thunderarmed, in battle. Maruts, let all the people in obeisance bow down before this youthful Srutaratha,Who, rich in steeds, gave me two dark red horses together with three hundred head of cattle.
