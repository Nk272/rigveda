==================================================

. COME thou to what the stones have pressed, drink Soma, O thou Soma's Lord,Indra best Vṛtra-slayer Strong One, with the Strong. Strong is the stone, the draught is strong, strong is this Soma that is pressed,Indra, best Vṛtra-slayer, Strong One with the Strong. As strong I call on thee the Strong, O Thunder-armed, with various aids,Indra, best Vṛtra-slayer, Strong One with the Strong. Impetuous, Thunderer, Strong, quelling the mighty, King, potent, Vṛtra-slayer, Soma-drinker,May he come hither with his yoked Bay Horses; may Indra gladden him at the noon libation. O Sūrya, when the Asura's descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness,All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing. What time thou smotest down Svarbhanu's magic that spread itself beneath the sky, O Indra,By his fourth sacred prayer Atri disoovered Sūrya concealed in gloom that stayed his function. Let not the oppressor with this dread, through anger swallow me up, for I am thine, O Atri.Mitra art thou, the sender of true blessings: thou and King Varuṇa be both my helpers. The Brahman Atri, as he set the press-stones, serving the Gods with praise and adoration,Established in the heaven the eye of Sūrya, and caused Svarbhanu's magic arts to vanish. The Atris found the Sun again, him whom Svarbhanu of the broodOf Asuras had pierced with gloom. This none besides had power to do.
