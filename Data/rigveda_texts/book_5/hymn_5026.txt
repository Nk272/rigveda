==================================================

. O AGNI, Holy and Divine, with splendour and thy pleasant tongueBring hither and adore the Gods. We pray thee, thou who droppest oil, bright-rayed! who lookest on the Sun,Bring the Gods hither to the feast. We have enkindled thee, O Sage, bright caller of the Gods to feast.O Agni, great in Sacrifice. O Agni, come with all the Gods, come to our sacrificial gift:We choose thee as Invoking Priest. Bring, Agni, to the worshipper who pours the juice, heroic strength:Sit with the Gods upon the grass. Victor of thousands, Agni, thou, enkindled, cherishest the laws,Laud-worthy, envoy of the Gods. Set Agni Jātavedas down, the bearer of our sacred gifts,MostYouthful, God and Minister. Duly proceed our sacrifice, comprising all the Gods, to-day:Strew holy grass to be their seat. So may the Maruts sit thereon, the Aśvins, Mitra, Varuṇa:The Gods with all their company.
