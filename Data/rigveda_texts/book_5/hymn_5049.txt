==================================================

. THIS day I bring God Savitar to meet you, and Bhaga who allots the wealth of mortals.You, Aśvins, Heroes rich in treasures, daily seeking your friendship fain would I turn hither. Knowing full well the Asura's time of coming, worship God Savitar with hymns and praises.Let him who rightly knoweth speak with homage to him who dealeth out man's noblest treasure. Not for reward doth Pūṣan send his blessings, Bhaga, or Aditi: his garb is splendour.May Indra, Visniu, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni produce auspicious days, the Wonder-Workers. Sending the shelter which we ask, the foeless Savitar and the Rivers shall approach us.When I, the sacrifice's priest, invite them, may we he lords of wealth and rich possessions. They who devote such worship to the Vasus, singing their hymns to Varuṇa and Mitra,Vouchsafe them ample room, far off be danger. Through grace of Heaven and Earth may we be happy.
