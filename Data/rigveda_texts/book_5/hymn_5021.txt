==================================================

. WE stablish thee as Manus used, as Manus used we kindle thee.Like Manus, for the pious man , Aá¹…giras, Agni, worship Gods. For well, O Agni, art thou pleased when thou art kindled mid mankind.Straight go the ladles unto thee, thou highborn God whose food is oil. Thee have all Gods of one accord established as their messenger.Serving at sacrifices men adore thee as a God, O Sage. Let mortal man adore your God, Agni, with worship due to Gods.Shine forth enkindled, Radiant One. Sit in the chamber of the Law, sit in the chamber of the food.
