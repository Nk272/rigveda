==================================================

. O AGNI, King and Lord of wealth and treasures, in thee is my delight at sacrifices.Through thee may we obtain the strength we long for, and overcome the fierce attacks of mortals. Agni, Eternal Father, offering-bearer, fair to behold, far-reaching, far-refulgent,From well-kept household fire beam food to feed us, and measure out to us abundant glory. The Sage of men, the Lord of human races, pure, purifying Agni, balmed with butter,Him the Omniscient as your Priest ye stablish: he wins among the Gods things worth the choosing. Agni, enjoy, of one accord with Iḷā, striving in rivalry with beams of Sūrya,Enjoy, O Jātavedas, this our fuel, and bring the Gods to us to taste oblations. As dear House-Friend, guest welcome in the dwelling, to this our sacrifice come thou who knowest.And, Agni, having scattered all assailants, bring to us the possessions of our foemen. Drive thou away the Dasyu with thy weapon. As, gaining vital power for thine own body,O Son of Strength, the Gods thou satisfiest, so in fight save us, most heroic Agni. May we, O Agni, with our lauds adore thee, and with our gifts, fair-beaming Purifier!Send to us wealth containing all things precious: bestow upon us every sort of riches. Son of Strength, Agni, dweller in three regions, accept our sacrifice and our oblation.Among the Gods may we be counted pious: protect us with a triply-guarding shelter. Over all woes and dangers, Jātavedas, bear us as in a boat across a river.Praised with our homage even as Atri praised thee, O Agni, be the guardian of our bodies. As I, remembering thee with grateful spirit, a mortal, call with might on thee Immortal,Vouchsafe us high renown, O Jātavedas, and may I be immortal by my children. The pious man, O Jātavedas Agni, to whom thou grantest ample room and pleasure,Gaineth abundant wealth with sons and horses, with heroes and with kine for his well-being.
