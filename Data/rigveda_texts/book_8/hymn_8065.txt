==================================================

. NOT to forsake me, I invoke this Indra girt by Maruts,Lord Of magic power who rules with might. This Indra with his Marut Friends clave into pieces Vṛtra's beadWith hundred-knotted thunderbolt. Indra, with Marut Friends grown strong, hath rent asunder Vṛtra, andReleased the waters of the sea. This is that Indra who, begirt by Maruts, won the light of heavenThat he might drink the Soma juice. Mighty, impetuous, begirt by Maruts, him who loudly roars,Indra we invocate with songs. Indra begirt by Maruts we invoke after the ancient plan,That he may drink the Soma juice. O liberal Indra, Marut-girt, much-lauded Śatakratu, drinkThe Soma at this sacrifice. To thee, O Indra, Marut-girt, these Soma juices, Thunderer!Are offered from the heart with lauds. Drink, Indra, with thy Marut Friends, pressed Soma at the morning rites,Whetting thy thunderbolt with strength. Arising in thy might, thy jaws thou shookest, Indra, having quaffedThe Soma which the mortar pressed. Indra, both worlds complained to thee when uttering thy fearful roar,What time thou smotest Dasyus dead. From Indra have I measured out a song eight-footed with nine parts,Delicate, faithful. to the Law.
