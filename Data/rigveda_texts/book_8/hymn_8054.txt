==================================================

. THOUGH, Indra, thou art called by men from east and west, from north and south,Come hither quickly with fleet steeds If in the effluence of heaven, rich in its light, thou takest joy,Or in the sea in Soma juice. With songs I call thee, Great and Wide, even as a cow to profit us,Indra, to drink the Soma-draught. Hither, O Indra, let thy Bays bear up and, bring upon thy carThy glory, God! and majesty. Thou, Indra, wouldst be sung and praised as great, strong, lordly in thy deedsCome hither, drink our Soma juice. We who have shed the Soma and prepared the feast are calling thee.To sit on this our sacred grass. As, Indra, thou art evermore the common Lord of all alike,As such we invocate thee now. The men with stones have milked for thee this nectar of the Soma juice:Indra, be pleased with it, and drink. Neglect all pious men with skill in sacred song: come hitherward,With speed, and give us high renown. Gods, may the mighty rest unharmed, the King who gives me spotted kine,Kine decked with golden ornaments. Beside a thousand spotted kine I have received a gift of gold,Pure, brilliant, and exceeding great. Durgaha's grandsons, giving me a thousand kine, munificent,Have won renown among the Gods.
