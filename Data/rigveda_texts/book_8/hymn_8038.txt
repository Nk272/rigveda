==================================================

. YE Twain are Priests of sacrifice, winners in war and holy works:Indra and Agni, mark this well. Ye bounteous riders on the car, ye Vṛtra-slayers unsubdued:Indra and Agni, mark this well. The men with pressing-stones have pressed this meath of yours which gives delight:Indra, and Agni, mark this well. Accept our sacrifice for weal, sharers of praise! the Soma shed:Indra and Agni, Heroes, come. Be pleased with these libations which attract you to our sacred giftsIndra and Agni, Heroes, come. Accept this eulogy of mine whose model is the Gāyatrī:Indra and Agni, Heroes, Come. Come with the early-faring Gods, ye who are Lords of genuine wealth:Indra-Agni, to the Soma-draught Hear ye the call of Atris, hear Śyāvāśva as he sheds the juice:Indra-Agni to the Soma-draught Thus have I called you to our aid as sages called on you of old:Indra-Agni to the Soma draught! Indra's and Agni's grace I claim, Sarasvatī's associatesTo whom this psalm of praise is sung.
