==================================================

. LORD of all wealth, the Asura propped the heavens, and measured out the broad earth's wide expanses.He, King supreme, approached all living creatures. All these are Varuṇa's holy operations. So humbly worship Varuṇa the Mighty revere the wise Guard of World Immortal.May he vouchsafe us triply-barred protection. O Earth and Heaven, within your lap preserve us. Sharpen this song of him who strives his utmost, sharpen, God Varuṇa, his strength and insight;May we ascend the ship that bears us safely, whereby we may pass over all misfortune. Aśvins, with songs the singer stones have made you hasten hitherward,Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away. As the sage Atri with his hymns, O Aśvins, called you eagerly,Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away. So have I called you to our aid, even as the wise have called of old,Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away.
