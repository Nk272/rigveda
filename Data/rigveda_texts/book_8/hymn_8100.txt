==================================================

. THY bounty, Dasyave-vrka, exhaustless hath displayed itself:Its fulness is as broad as heaven. Ten thousand Dasyave-vrka, the son of Putakrata, hathFrom his own wealth bestowed on me. A hundred asses hath he given, a hundred head of fleecy sheep,A hundred slaves, and wreaths besides. There also was a mare led forth, picked out for Putakrata's sake,Not of the horses of the herd. Observant Agni hath appeared, oblation-bearer with his car.Agni with his resplendent flame hath shone on high as shines the Sun, hath shone like Sūrya in theheavens.
