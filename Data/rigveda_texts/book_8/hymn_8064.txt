==================================================

. YOKE, Agni, as a charioteer, thy steeds who best invite the Gods: As ancient Herald seat thyself. And, God, as skilfullest of all, call for us hitherward the Gods:Give all our wishes sure effect. For thou, Most Youthful, Son of Strength, thou to whom sacrifice is paid,Art holy, faithful to the Law. This Agni, Lord of wealth and spoil hundredfold, thousandfold, is headAnd chief of riches and a Sage. As craftsmen bend the felly, so bend at our general call: come nigh,Aṅgiras, to the sacrifice. Now, O Virūpa, rouse for him, Strong God who shines at early morn,Fair praise with voice that ceases not. With missile of this Agni, his who looks afar, will we lay lowThe thief in combat for the kine. Let not the Companies of Gods fail us, like Dawns that float away,Like cows who leave the niggardly. Let not the sinful tyranny of any fiercely hating foeSmite us, as billows smite a ship. O Agni, God, the people sing reverent praise to thee for strength:With terrors trouble thou the foe. Wilt thou not, Agni, lend us aid in winning cattle, winning wealth?Maker of room, make room for us. In this great battle cast us not aside as one who bears a load:Snatch up the wealth and win it all. O Agni, let this plague pursue and fright another and not us:Make our impetuous strength more strong. The reverent or unwearied man whose holy labour he accepts,Him Agni favours with success. Abandoning the foeman's host pass hither to this company:Assist the men with whom I stand. As we have known thy gracious help, as of a Father, long ago,So now we pray to thee for bliss.
