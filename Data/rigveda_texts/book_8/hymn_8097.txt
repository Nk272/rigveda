==================================================

. As highest of the Maghavans, preeminent among the Bulls,Best breaker-down of forts, kine-winner, Lord of wealth, we seek thee, Indra Maghavan. Thou who subduedst Āyu, Kutsa, Atithigva, waxing daily in thy might,As such, rousing thy power, we invocate thee now, thee Śatakratu, Lord of Bays. The pressing-stones shall pour for us the essence of the meath of all,Drops that have been pressed out afar among the folk, and those that have been pressed near us. Repel all enmities and keep thern far away: let all win treasure for their own.Even among Sistas are the stalks that make thee glad, where thou with Soma satest thee. Come, Indra, very near to us with aids of firmly-based resolve;Come, most auspicious, with thy most auspicious help, good Kinsman, with good kinsmen, come! Bless thou with progeny the chief of men, the lord of heroes, victor in the fray.Aid with thy powers the men who sing thee lauds and keep their spirits ever pure and bright. May we be such in battle as are surest to obtain thy grace:With holy offerings and invocations of the Gods, we mean, that we may win the spoil. Thine, Lord of Bays, am I. Prayer longeth for the spoil. Still with thy help I seek the fight.So, at the raiders' head, I, craving steeds and kine, unite myself with thee alone.
