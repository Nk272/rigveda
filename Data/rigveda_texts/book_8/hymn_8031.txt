==================================================

. THAT Brahman pleases Indra well, who worships, sacrifices, pours Libation, and prepares the meal. Śakra protects from woe the man who gives him sacrificial cake.And offers Soma blent with milk. His chariot shall be glorious, sped by Gods, and mighty shall he be,Subduing all hostilities. Each day that passes, in his house flows his libation, rich in milk,Exhaustless, bringing progeny. O Gods, with constant draught of milk, husband and wife with one accordPress out and wash the Soma juice. They gain sufficient food: they come united to the sacred grass,And never do they fail in strength. Never do they deny or seek to hide the favour of the Gods:They win high glory for themselves. With sons and daughters by their side they reach their full extent of life,Both decked with ornaments of gold. Serving the Immortal One with gifts of sacrificial meal and wealth,They satisfy the claims of love and pay due honour to the Gods. We claim protection from the Hills, we claim protection of the Floods,Of him who stands by Viṣṇu's side. May Pūṣan come, and Bhaga, Lord of wealth, All-bounteous, for our wealBroad be the path that leads to bliss: Aramati, and, free from foes, Visva with spirit of a God,And the Ādityas’ peerless might. Seeing that Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuṇa are guarding us,The paths of Law are fair to tread. I glorify with song, for wealth, Agni the God, the first of you.We honour as a well-loved Friend the God who prospereth our fields. As in all frays the hero, so swift moves his car whom Gods attend.The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not. Ne’er are ye injured, worshipper, presser of juice, or pious man.The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not. None in his action equals him, none holds him far or keeps him off.The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not. Such strength of heroes shall be his, such mastery of fleet-foot steeds.The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not.
