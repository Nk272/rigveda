==================================================

. INDRA, the poets with. their hymns extol this hero might of thine:They strengthened, loud in song, thy power that droppeth oil. With hymns the Pauras came to thee. Through piety they came to Indra for his aid, they whose libations give theejoy.As thou with, Krsa and Samvarta hast rejoiced, so, Indra, be thou glad with us. Agreeing in your spirit, all ye Deities, come nigh to us.Vasus and Rudras shall come near to give us aid, and Maruts listen to our call. May Pūṣan, Viṣṇu, and Sarasvatī befriend, and the Seven Streams, this call of mine:May Waters, Wind, the Mountains, and the Forest-Lord, and Earth give ear unto my cry. Indra, with thine own bounteous gift, most liberal of the Mighty Ones,Be our boon benefactor, Vṛtra-slayer, be our feast-companion for our weal. Leader of heroes, Lord of battle, lead thou us to combat, thou Most Sapient One.High fame is theirs who win by invocations, feasts and entertainment of the Gods. Our hopes rest on the Faithful One: in Indra is the people's life.O Maghavan, come nigh that thou mayst give us aid: make plenteous food stream forth for us. Thee would we worship, Indra, with our songs of praise: O Śatakratu, be thou ours.Pour down upon Praskaṇva bounty vast and firm, exuberant, that shall never fail.
