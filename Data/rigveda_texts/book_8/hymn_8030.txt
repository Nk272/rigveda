==================================================

. NOT one of you, ye Gods, is small, none of you is a feeble child:All of you, verily, are great. Thus be ye lauded, ye destroyers of the foe, ye Three-and-Thirty Deities,The Gods of man, the Holy Ones. As such defend and succour us, with benedictions speak to us:Lead us not from our fathers' and from Manu's path into the distance far away. Ye Deities who stay with us, and all ye Gods of all mankind,Give us your wide protection, give shelter for cattle and for steed.
