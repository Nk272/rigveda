==================================================

. To this mine invocation, O ye Aśvins, ye Nāsatyas, come,To drink the savoury Soma juice. This laud of mine, ye Aśvins Twain, and this mine invitation hear,To drink the savoury Soma juice. Here Kṛṣṇa is invoking you, O Aśvins, Lords of ample wealth.To drink the savoury Soma juice. List, Heroes, to the singer's call, the call of Kṛṣṇa lauding you,To drink the savoury Soma juice. Chiefs, to the sage who sings your praise grant an inviolable home,To drink the savoury Soma juice. Come to the worshipper's abode, Aśvins, who here is lauding you,To drink the savoury Soma juice. Yoke to the firmly jointed car the ass which draws you, Lords of wealth.To drink the savoury Soma juice. Come hither, Aśvins, on your car of triple form with triple seat,To drink the savoury Soma juice. O Aśvins, O Nāsatyas, now accept with favouring grace my songs,To drink the savoury Soma juice.
