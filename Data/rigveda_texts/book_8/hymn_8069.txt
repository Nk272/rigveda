==================================================

. O Sarakratu! truely I have made none else my Comforter.Indra; be gracious unto us. Thou who hast ever aided us kindly of old to win the spoil,As such, O Indra, favour us. What now? As prompter of the poor thou helpest him who sheds the juice.Wilt thou not, Indra, strengthen us? O Indra, help our chariot on, yea, Thunderer, though it lag behind:Give this my car the foremost place. Ho there! why sittest thou at case? Make thou my chariot to be firstAnd bring the fame of victory near. Assist our car that seeks the prize. What can be easier for thee?So make thou us victorious. Indra, be firm: a fort art thou. To thine appointed place proceedsThe auspicious hymn in season due. Let not our portion be disgrace. Broad is the course, the prize is set,The barriers are opened wide. This thing we wish. that thou mayst take thy fourth, thy sacrificial name.So art thou held to be our Lord. Ekadyu hath exalted you, Immortals: both Goddesses and Gods hath he delighted.Bestow upon him bounty meet for praises. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.
