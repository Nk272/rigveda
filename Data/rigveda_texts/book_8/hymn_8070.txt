==================================================

. INDRA, God of the mighty arm, gather for us with thy right handManifold and nutritious spoil. We know thee mighty in thy deeds, of mighty bounty, mighty wealth,Mighty in measure, prompt to aid. Hero, when thou art fain to give, neither may Gods nor mortal menRestrain thee like a fearful Bull. Come, let us glorify Indra, Lord supreme of wealth, Self-ruling King:In bounty may he harm us not. Let prelude sound and following chant so let him hear the SƒÅman sung,And with his bounty answer us. O Indra, with thy right hand bring, and with thy left remember us.Let us not lose our share of wealth. Come nigh, O Bold One, boldly bring hither the riches of the churlWho giveth least of all the folk. Indra, the booty which thou hast with holy singers to receive,Even that booty win with us. Indra, thy swiftly-coming spoil, the booty which rejoices all,Sounds quick in concert with our hopes.
