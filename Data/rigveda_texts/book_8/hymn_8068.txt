==================================================

. THIS here is Soma, ne’er restrained, active, all-conquering bursting forth,Ṛṣi and Sage by sapience, All that is bare he covers o’er, all that is sick he medicines;The blind man sees, the cripple walks. Thou, Soma, givest wide defence against the hate of alien men,Hatreds that waste and weaken us. Thou by thine insight and thy skill, Impetuous One, from heaven and earthDrivest the sinner's enmity. When to their task they come with zeal, may they obtain the Giver's grace,And satisfy his wish who thirsts. So may he find what erst was lost, so may be speed the pious man,And lengthen his remaining life. Gracious, displaying tender love, unconquered, gentle in thy thoughts,Be sweet, O Soma, to our heart. O Soma, terrify us not; strike us not with alarm, O King:Wound not our heart with dazzling flame. When in my dwelling-place I see the wicked enemies of Gods,King, chase their hatred far away, thou Bounteous One, dispel our foes.
